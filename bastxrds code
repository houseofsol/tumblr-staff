<p>while i don't have a full time job i make it a point not to spend every waking hour on tumblr. i'm here as much as i feel like i can. and when i'm not you can always find me lurking on discord.
<p>
<br />
<p><center><h3>disclaimer&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>

<p>(1) this blog was created for roleplaying purposes. i am not talia al ghul, magnus bane, eames, tony stark, or their associated actors and i have nothing to do with the properties that they can be found in.
<p>(2) all icons that look like rounded squares, rectangles with symbols or cut off corners or are vertical were created by me with screencaps that i made and i ask that you do not steal them.
<p>
<br />
<p><center><h3>if nothing else read this&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>

<p>(1) the portrayals found on this blog are ones i've worked a long time on. i will <b>NOT</b> change my interpretation of my muses in ways that detract from their core foundations. my muses are my own entity. if i start noticing that you’re ignoring parts of my characters because you don’t like it/don’t agree with it, i reserve the right to drop all threads without warning.
<p>(2) start drama with me about my friends? block me now - because we’re done.
<p>(3) i unfollow for the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9642; inactive for thirty (30) days or more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9642; too much ooc content<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9642; too much political content<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9642; posting of drama<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9642; too much negativity
<p>
<br />
<p><center><h3>about&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>

<p>(1) most of the muses on this blog are <b>canon divergent</b> &amp; heavily headcanon influenced. please read their biographies and verses before approaching.
<p>(2) this blog is <b>queue</b> heavy.  what that means is all of the replies will be put into a queue that will a certain amount of replies every other day depending on my draft count. this is for my sanity and to keep the dash from being flooded with replies. don’t hesitate to send me an ask if you want to know when your reply will be posted.
<p>(3) this blog has a <b>weekend rule</b>. what that means is each saturday and sunday will be spent away from tumblr completely. no replies, no follow backs, no asks, no nothing on tumblr will be done until the following monday.
<p>(4) the queue is tagged for your blacklisting purposes.
<p>(5) this blog is <b>highly selective</b>. what that means is i will carefully look over a blog to see whether or not i can see myself writing with them. i also look to see if our writing could be compatible. this blog is also <b>mutuals</b> only. meaning if i follow you and you follow me. all starter calls are for <b>mutuals only</b>. please double check to see if we are following each other before or liking a starter call. <b>memes</b> are open to <b>non-mutuals</b> unless otherwise tagged.
<p>(6) i do not follow for follow. if we write together continuously, or we have plotted something out long term I have no problem hitting the follow button. otherwise i prefer to keep a relatively clean dash. this is nothing against you. this is for myself and my dash.
<p>(7) when it comes to unfollowing it is usually done for the following reasons: inactive for thirty (30) days or more, too much ooc content, posting of drama, or too much negativity. i’m here to write, have fun, and forget about the real world for just a little bit. if you decide to return to your inactive blog and we were mutuals feel free to hit me up and i’ll refollow. otherwise i figure you have decided to move on from that blog and see no point in following an inactive one.
<p>(8) i will also unfollow anyone who decides to attack, harass, or do anything similar to those i consider my friends. in my opinion if you go after someone i call friend you are going after me and i will not tolerate that no matter what.
<p>(9) please do not contact me and ask why i unfollowed you. any and all such asks will be deleted as they are covered in the rules. harassing me in such a matter will only lead me to block you instead of just unfollowing you.
<p>(10) do not god-mod my character. if i catch you doing so without my permission consider the thread dropped.
<p>(11) this is a hate free blog. any hate received will be deleted on sight. if i find those i follow sending hate i will unfollow you in a heartbeat. remember to treat others as you would like to be treated in return.
<p>(12) with this blog i prefer to roleplay multi-para to novella. while i can write one liners i feel like there is no character development to those threads and can be easily dropped. multi-para to me is a minimum of three paragraphs, while novella is anywhere over 1k words.
<p>(13) please <b>do not reblog</b> threads unless you are a participant in them. feel free to like them all you want but unless you and i are writing together i ask that you don’t reblog them as it makes it difficult to keep up with whose turn it is in the thread.
<p>(14) please <b>make a new post</b> if you want to continue asks. i am all for continuing asks but i will not respond to any that have not been moved into a new post.
<p>(15) when it comes to memes <b>please specify a muse</b>. if you don't specify any muse your ask will be deleted no questions asked. i'm not a mind reader and i'm not going to throw a muse at you that you may be uncomfortable with.

<p>
<br />
<p><center><h3>the mun&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>

<p>(1) the mun has a life outside of tumblr and asks that everyone please be patient. any and all replies that are seen will be replied to. if for some reason a reply has been missed a gentle reminder in the ask box is appreciated. but please do not constantly harass the mun for a reply.
<p>(2) the mun is of age (21+) which means there will be nsfw elements on this blog. that could mean violence, torture, gore, and scenes of a sexual nature. we will <b>not</b> write sexual scenes with those who are under 18. there is the option of fade to black or the morning after for those who are not of age
<p>(3) all nsfw posts will be tagged <b>not safe for the city</b> for your blacklisting purposes.

<p>
<br />
<p><center><h3>relationships&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>

<p>(1) this is a multi-ship, multi-verse blog. i ship chemistry first and foremost. if there is chemistry a relationship is possible. please read the muses biographies and verses to get an idea as to what sorts of relationships they are open to.
<p>(2) when it comes to relationships my muses span the spectrum to be outlined on their respective biographies. relationships with these muses will not be easy but if you're willing to put in the work they will be worth it
<p>(3) <b>IF YOU WRITE A CANON ROMANTIC PARTNER:</b> while i do acknowledge those relationships as canon i will not roleplay it instantly. i would prefer that we have written together to make certain that our writing styles are compatible. after that i ask that we have at least spoken out of character first. while it isn’t necessary it helps to have that communication out of character.
<p>(4) please do not force a ship on me. nor try to engage us in instant ships. i prefer all ships to be written out and developed over time. forced shipping, instant ships, etc. are the fastest way to send us both running in the opposite direction.
<p>(5) there is more to my muses than their fcs. if you are here to do nothing more than to get into bed with them i ask that you do not follow. i am not here to write purely smut. I prefer to write threads with plots and if smut happens, it happens as part of the thread.

<p>
<br />
<p><center><h3>exclusivity&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>

<p>(1) at this time this blog is exclusive to a select group of muses. those that are exclusive to this blog as a whole are listed on the <b>pan-blog exclusives</b> tab. there are <b>two</b> exceptions to the pan-blog exclusives and that is sophie moore &amp; jacob kane. <b>affcgato</b> is our main kate kane but she is not exclusive to sophie moore nor jacob kane. those that are exclusive to a certain muse can be found on that muse's popup.
<p>(2) what this means is i will not write with any other version of the muses listed under exclusive. it has nothing to do with you and your muse. there is a connection between their muse and my own that i feel can't be replicated.
<p>(3) the exclusivity can and will change if muses go inactive or delete. also, being exclusive means we've talked a great deal ooc and have plotted things out between our muses. while i would prefer it to be mutual i will not demand it.

<p>
<br />
<p><center><h3>ocs &amp; children&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>

<p>(1) this blog is oc friendly but selective due to past problems. i will give your muse a chance but if i feel like our writing styles are incompatible i will drop the thread
<p>(2) in regards to children, all muses will not acknowledge any original characters that claim them as the parent. please don’t take this personally as this is nothing against you, the mun, but a personal preference of mine. canon children associated with each muse, on the other hand, will be acknowledged.

<p>

Marc Spector aka Moon Knight was a Jewish-American former US Marine turned C.I.A. agent. After leaving both organizations in disgrace, he became a soldier of fortune. He was left for dead in the desert, on a mercenary mission in North Sudan, where an idol of the Egyptian moon god Khonshu saved him and gave him his moon-based powers. Returning to the US with a newfound lease on life he took up multiple identities such as "Steven Grant", and "Jake Lockley" to fight crime which, when alongside childhood trauma, also caused him to lapse back into Dissociative Identity Disorder.

"John" Walker is a super soldier and a former Captain of the U.S. Army's 75th Rangers Regiment. A highly decorated soldier, Walker was chosen to succeed Steve Rogers as Captain America. However, his aspirations of living up to Rogers' legacy attracted the ire of Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes in their pursuit of the Flag Smashers, during which he took the Super Soldier Serum after failing to apprehend Karli Morgenthau. When his partner and best friend Lemar Hoskins was killed in action, Walker brutally murdered a surrendering foreign national in public, leading to him being stripped of his mantle and discharged with total loss of rank. Creating his own shield, Walker confronted Morgenthau again in New York City, before abandoning his revenge, and joining Wilson and Barnes in thwarting her attack on the GRC. Recruited by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, he was given a black uniform and rebranded as U.S. Agent.

<center><h3>the man in the suit</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Tony Stark is a genius inventor and billionaire industrialist, who suits up in his armor of cutting-edge technology to become the super hero Iron Man. The adopted son of weapons manufacturer Howard Stark, Tony inherited his family's company at a young age following his parents' death. While overseeing a manufacturing plant in a foreign country, Stark was kidnapped by local terrorists. Instead of giving in to his captors' demands to build weapons for them, Stark created a powerful suit of armor for himself to escape. Returning to America, Stark further upgraded the armor and put his vast resources and intellect to use for the betterment of the world as Iron Man.
<p>Tony kept his alter-ego a secret for most of his career, juggling his responsibilities as head of Stark Industries while becoming a key player in the superhuman community as Iron Man and founding the world's premier super hero team, the Avengers. Over the years, Stark has faced numerous enemies, such as the Mandarin, Justin Hammer, Iron Monger and the Titanium Man, as well as many personal demons, most notably his addiction to alcohol. For many years, Tony covered for his alter-ego by claiming that Iron Man was his anonymous bodyguard, but Tony eventually brought his dual identity to the public light.
<p>Recently, Tony escaped death by reconfiguring his body with a digital back-up of his mind, inadvertently causing him to become temporarily convinced that he was a clone of the real, late Tony Stark. This resulted in Tony leading an army of artificial-life forms in a war against the anti-A.I. campaign of his adoptive brother Arno. After coming around to the fact that he was the real Tony Stark all along, Tony stopped Arno's deranged plan to enslave humanity to stop a non-existent alien threat, and he then opted to embark on a journey of self-discovery to escape the baggage of his career. Stepping away from his high-tech lifestyle, Tony finds himself returning to his roots in an attempt to put back the "man" in Iron Man.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>personality</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Tony Stark is, for the lack of a better word, complicated. During his early days of success, Stark was a man who only cared about fame and wealth. He had no sense of responsibility or humility, always rubbing his success in the faces of everyone he met. This all changed when he was captured by terrorists. After building the first Iron Man armor and escaping captivity, Stark realized the kind of person he really was, and engaged in a life of heroism to atone for his past mistakes.
<p>Plagued by many vices, Stark is prone to womanizing, pride, and, most of all, alcoholism. The latter was an addiction developed in big part due to Howard's abuse of Tony, who forced him to take his first sip when he was a child. This lifetime of troubles has caused him to develop a cynical view of the world.
<p>Despite this, Stark is devoted to truly make the world a better place. This desire has sometimes caused Stark to resort to morally questionable methods, as long as the end justifies them, including his crusade to safeguard his technology (leading him to confront heroes such as Stingray and the Captain), and the superhuman Civil War, during which Iron Man was hell bent on implementing the Superhuman Registration Act, because its failure would have led to a harsh response from the government. However, Iron Man has shown to be ridden by guilt over this type of course of action, which has developed into self-hate. Tony Stark has been described as "man enough to do what needs to be done, even knowing full well what it will cost him." Stark's self-hating tendencies have also led to Stark being suicidal, and undervaluing his own life, specially in favor of others'.
<p>According to Reed Richards, Tony Stark is "a future man trapped in the now. A prisoner raging against the slow crawl of human evolution." Stark's relationships, morality and ethics are highly adaptable and malleable to what he would consider the greater good of mankind's necessary survival and progress. Tony has also been described as "[A person who] really cares. He's been on the top and he's been on the bottom and he's done all 12 steps and a few more. He knows what it's like to have a habit that eats you from the inside, like worms. And he knows there's no easy answer, but every solution to every problem has to start somewhere. He's just trying to help."
<p>Tony has also been shown to loathe taking other people's lives, and resorting to killing people only as a extreme measure, and explicitly stating he doesn't kill, and having claimed that's "not the way we work."
<p>Iron Man is a hero that relies on his intellect and technological resources to defeat foes and achieve victory. Stark invariably prides himself on being one of the most intelligent people of the Marvel Universe.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>alcoholism</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Still a child, Tony was introduced to alcohol by Howard, when his adoptive father forcibly gave Tony his first drink while inebriated. As a teenager, Tony would drink frequently starting when he was fifteen years old, mainly to allow himself to better fit in with his classmates and to impress girls. As a young adult, Tony even worked under the influence of alcohol, claiming to have made groundbreaking work while drunk.
<p>During his adulthood, Tony increased his frequency of drinking once S.H.I.E.L.D. threatened to buy his company, and his armor malfunctioned. Stark's increasingly irresponsible behavior, including handling his Iron Man armor drunk and mistreating his butler and friend Edwin Jarvis, led him to finally ask Bethany Cabe for help, who would help him fight his alcoholism for the first time.
<p>Due to the machinations of Obadiah Stane, Stark relapsed. He got replaced by Rhodey as Iron Man and got kicked off the Avengers. Stark's condition worsened, and he became homeless. After the death of Tony's drinking partner Gretl Anders on his arms on a cold night after she gave birth, Tony found a new appreciation for life, and he finally asked for Rhodey to help him overcome his addiction. Weeks later, Stark re-assumed the mantle of Iron Man.
<p>By the time of the Heroic Age, he managed to stay sober until his meeting with Odin during the Serpent War. Despite this, he was able to stay sober and control his drinking the following months. During an incursion he believed was going to destroy the Earth, Tony decided to line up numerous shots of alcoholic beverages and managed not to touch them, as even if he couldn't save the world, he wanted to "beat" his addiction. Due to the casting of an "inversion spell" during World War Hate, Tony's moral compass became inverted, and his changed personality caused him to re-indulge in his alcoholism, apparently to "make up for wasted time" of sobriety.
<p>After the effects of the inversion spell were somehow reverted, Tony went back to abstinence, and continued attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings when he felt it was necessary.
<p>During a crisis involving a virtual reality of Tony's creation named the eScape, Tony was abducted and brainwashed by the eScape's rogue A.I. Motherboard. Motherboard reverted Tony's personality to his younger years, causing him to drink again. Tony eventually broke free from Motherboard's grasp, but his renewed urge to drink carried into the real world. With the help of his friends, Tony managed to abstain from drinking. However, with the revelation that he was seemingly only a copy of the real, late Tony Stark following his return from a coma, Tony appeared to have given in to the drinking urge he had been fighting since breaking out of the eScape.

<br />
<center><h3>powers</h3></center>
<p>Tony Stark currently possesses no biological enhancements. At one point he had gained superhuman abilities due to interactions with certain types of technologies, namely the Extremis virus, but they have become inaccessible ever since.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>abilities</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>&#9642; <b>Super-Genius Intelligence:</b> Quite apart from the powers granted him by the suit, Tony Stark is far more than a mechanical engineering prodigy who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with honors at the age of 17. With an intelligence classified as super-genius, he easily is one of the smartest people on Earth. Furthermore, this extends to his remarkable ingenuity dealing with difficult situations such as foes and deathtraps where he is capable of using his available tools, like his suit, in unorthodox and effective ways, for example when he built the first Iron Man Armor in captivity. He has also been able to hack technology from the Kree, a race centuries more advanced than humans. Tony's genius allows him to act as a futurist, a person capable of intuiting the future based on current trends, to the point of foreshadowing that a situation like the superhuman Civil War was going to happen years before it did. This ability also extends to a much smaller scale, with Tony being capable of predicting with accuracy the way an interaction with a given individual will go down even before talking with them, a faculty that makes it really hard for human interactions to surprise him, and causes him to sometimes finish other people's sentences. Stark can use his superior intellect to the levels of dividing his consciousness with the help of Stark Datashades and perfectly operate three portions of his consciousness at the same time, being able to move, fight, talk and process information in three different bodies at the same time. Tony has been mentioned by Reed Richards to be the world's best multitasker.
<p>&#9642; <b>Master Engineer:</b> He is an excellent engineer and mechanic capable of fixing almost any, if not all machinery.
<p>&#9642; <b>Master Businessman:</b> Stark is extremely well-respected in the business world, able to command people's attentions when he speaks on economic matters by virtue of the fact that he is savvy enough to have, over the years, built up several multi-million dollar companies from virtually nothing. He is known for the loyalty he commands from and returns to those who work for him, as well as his impeccable business ethics. He also strives to be environmentally responsible in his businesses, and in one case, immediately fired an employee who made profitable (but illegal) sales to Doctor Doom. He states that if he wanted to, he could give away his entire fortune and build it up again within a week. Stark most notably turned his father's munitions firm into a multi-national corporation that covered virtually all contemporary scientific industry when barely in his early twenties.
<p>&#9642; <b>Master Tactician:</b> He is a brilliant tactician capable of quickly formulating battle strategies and new plans if the situation changes, like being able to elaborate different complex plans in order to defeat different enemies in difficult situations, and be victorious. Even going as far as to simultaneously put Reed Richards in check on five different boards playing chess, a game he didn't learn until later in his life, leaving Richards totally astonished.
<p>&#9642; <b>Skilled Combatant:</b> Stark was trained in unarmed combat by Captain America, Black Widow, Black Panther, and Shang-Chi, making him a quite physically formidable combatant on his own when the situation demands it. He has managed to fight Hammer Industries guards, defeat five Skrull soldiers in single-handed combat, Stark Industries security guards, numerous Voldi gladiators, handle his own against Madame Hydra, and bare-handedly confront several ninja.
<p>&#9642; <b>Skilled Marksman:</b> Tony knows how to handle firearms, mainly the ones he has produced.
<p>&#9642; <b>Multilingual:</b> Apart from English, Tony can speak different languages fluently, including Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, French, Russian, and Korean. He also might know multiple Middle Eastern languages, at one point noting that Urdu wasn't his strong suit in particular.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>Physical Strength</h3></center>
<p>Without his armor Tony Stark possesses a strength a little superior than that of a normal human, he also engages in moderate regular exercise. The armor amplifies Stark's strength to incalculable levels, enabling him to normally lift (press) roughly 100 tons. If sufficiently powered by an outside source, the armor can achieve massively higher levels.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>Weaknesses</h3></center>
<p>&#9642; <b>Alcoholism:</b> While Tony has quit drinking, when he used to, Stark would occasionally operate the Iron Man armor while intoxicated, compromising his efficiency. Now that he continues to struggle and avoid falling off the wagon, Tony's alcoholism has made him susceptible to the prospect of drinking, specially when under pressure.

<p>&#9642; <b>earth-199999:</b> tony stark survived the end of endgame. while the damage to his arm was extensive with the help of helen cho they were able to save some functionality to it. this spurred him to rework the nano technology he used for his suits to work on healing the damage. in time he regains full functionality in his arm. unfortunately, there is still extensive scarring which will never completely heal and is why you will rarely see him in short sleeve shirts out in public. while he's not ashamed of it, he's still coming to terms with the fact that one of his arms is more scarred than the other. tony also had the arc reactor implanted back into his chest. one of the side effects of the gauntlet was a weakening of his heart and he needs the reactor to keep his heart from giving out on him thanks to the damage done from the gauntlet.
<p>&#9642; <b>earth-199999:</b> when it comes to avengers tower, he didn't sell it as seen in spider-man: homecoming. the tower meant a lot to him and he kept it while also building the upstate headquarters that serves as the headquarters for the avengers. in the tower each of the original avengers has their own apartment. each apartment takes up one single floor of the tower. when there are guests in the tower there are plenty of available suites that can be used. the guest suites tend to take up two-three floors depending on how each one is laid out. friday is the current ai that runs the tower while jocasta is the ai he uses in his suits. tony also has his workshop where he can be found working on new iterations of his suits while also improving the technology used by shield and by the avengers.

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>the file</h3></center>
<p>&#9642; <b>name:</b> marc spector
<p>&#9642; <b>height:</b> 1.88m
<p>&#9642; <b>hair colour:</b> brown
<p>&#9642; <b>eye colour:</b> dark brown
<p>&#9642; <b>sexual orientation:</b> heterosexual
<p>&#9642; <b>species:</b> human
<p>&#9642; <b>relatives:</b> elias spector (deceased), randall spector (brother, deceased), marlene alraune (wife), diatrice alraune (daughter)
<p>&#9642; <b>other aliases:</b> Jake Lockley, Steven Grant, Fist of Khonshu, Yitzak Topol 
<br /> <br />
<p>Marc Spector is better known as the vigilante Moon Knight. Once a mercenary, Marc Spector was left for dead in the desert, where he was revived by the Moon god Khonshu. Appointed as Khonshu's fist and high priest, Moon Knight enacts justice to protect those who travel at night. Spector also suffers from dissociative identity disorder, which has paved the way for his use of other identities, including millionaire Steven Grant and cab driver Jake Lockley.
<p>In the beginning of his career, Marc fought crime on the streets with the help of a network of informants, including his best friend "Frenchie" Duchamp, the homeless Bertrand Crawley and diner owner Gena Landers. Since the early days, Marc has mostly worked alone, but he's also been a member of a few superhero teams, including the Avengers (both the Black Ops Unit and the West Coast branch) and the Heroes For Hire.
<p>Recently, Marc discovered he had a daughter named Diatrice with his long-time lover Marlene Alraune, but when Khonshu sensed Mephisto's plans for world domination, Marc left her to fight by his god's side and prevent that from coming true. When Khonshu succumbed to madness, however, Marc had to turn against him and help the Avengers defeat him. Following Khonshu's imprisonment, Spector established the Midnight Mission to offer his help to any night dweller who might need his assistance.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>early life</h3></center>
<p>Marc Spector was born in the United States, the son of a rabbi who as a child had managed to escape Nazi prosecution after Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia. Marc grew up on the poor side of Chicago, where his father Elias was the target of discrimination; Marc couldn't understand why his father would never fight back against persecution.
<p>During the last years of his childhood, Marc discovered by chance that a close friend of his family, Rabbi Yitz Perlman, was in reality a Nazi deserter and secretly a serial killer of Jews named Ernst. Marc's fighting instinct kicked off for the first time when he fended off against Perlman to escape his grasp. Perlman later disappeared without a trace. This traumatic event also caused Marc to develop a dissociative identity disorder. The first alters developed by Marc were Steven Grant and Jake Lockley. Shortly before Elias decided to intern Marc at the Putnam Psychiatric Hospital, Marc was approached for the first time by the Egyptian deity Khonshu, claiming to be Marc's true progenitor.
<p>After his father's death, Marc was allowed to leave the hospital temporarily to attend the funeral and a late luncheon, but, after hearing Khonshu's voice, he ran way.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>mercenary life</h3></center>
<p>Marc enlisted in the Marines and served for three years. On his second tour in Iraq, his superiors caught notice of Marc's bizarre behavior. After his past was dug up, Marc was dishonorably discharged. He later joined the CIA, and worked with several people who would later interact with Moon Knight, including William Cross, Amos Lardner, and his own brother, Randall Spector. Randall killed Spector's girlfriend Lisa with a hatchet to keep her from exposing a gun-running scheme; Spector retaliated with a grenade and assumed Randall was dead.
<p>Once he left the CIA, Spector enrolled in illegal fights, where he befriended "Frenchie" Duchamp and both became soldiers-for-hire. They took on several assignments, mainly in Africa and South America. Spector later went to trial for assassinating the president of Bosqueverde, a South American country.
<p>After Spector and Frenchie met Raul Bushman in Egypt, they travelled to North Sudan, near the egyptian border, for a raid on archaological site. When Bushman killed the lead archaeologist, Peter Alraune, to find an Egyptian pharaoh's tomb, Spector punched Bushman to protect Alraune's daughter, Marlene. Furious, Bushman mortally wounded him in the desert, killing everyone in the place except for Marlene, Frenchie and a villager willing to tell him the secrets of the tomb. Spector managed to reach the tomb before he collapsed, and Marlene and the crew laid him beneath an idol of Khonshu. His spirit had an encounter with Khonshu, who promised to save his life in exchange for his service. Spector agreed, although he later considered this encounter a hallucination. Restored to life, he punished Bushman's men, while Bushman himself escaped.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>becoming moon knight</h3></center>
<p>Having finally found a purpose in life, Spector applied himself fully. He moved to New York with Frenchie and Marlene (now his lover), and developed the costume, equipment, and persona of Moon Knight. With a fortune made from gambling, in addition to support his new career of fighting crime, he began using his Steven Grant persona as a financier and Jake Lockley as a cab driver whose purpose was to gather information at street level. His original persona, with its multiple facets, faded into the background. Still, leading four separate lives put great mental stress on Spector. Lockley developed a network of informants, including the homeless Bertrand Crawley, diner owner Gena Landers, and her two sons, Ricky and Ray.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>personality</h3></center>
<p>Moon Knight can be best characterized by his relationship with Khonshu, and whether that is derived from his own mental illness or from actual divine inspiration. When Marc Spector first awakened at the foot of Khonshu's statue, it was ambiguous whether his survival was truly Khonshu's doing or if Spector merely attributed it to the Moon God. Later stories introduced Khonshu as an undeniably real god, employing Moon Knight as his agent. Subsequent takes on Moon Knight would attempt to "walk back" the revelation that Khonshu was real, once again questioning whether the drive to be "the moon's knight of vengeance" was all in Spector's head.
<p>Presently, it seems as if Marc Spector is both mentally ill and an agent of a higher power. Khonshu does exist, and has chosen Marc as his avatar, but Marc's mental illness sometimes causes him to experience conversations with a Khonshu that is only in his mind, not with the actual god. There are also discrepancies over whether Marc Spector was already schizophrenic or dissociative from an early age (making him a convenient host for Khonshu) or if Khonshu imposed this mental condition upon Marc. Khonshu is a god of multiple facets, and Marc Spector has taken on multiple identities in the past in order to properly represent all aspects of his god. This includes his original alter egos of Steven Grant, Jake Lockley, and Moon Knight, the representations of Captain America, Wolverine, and Spider-Man communicating with him, or his recent set of identities and attire like Mr. Knight.
<p>Unlike most superheroes, Moon Knight is willing to brutally hurt and maim his opponents, and sometimes has even killed his enemies, as is seen by his ripping the face off Raul Bushman, or carving crescents on his victims' foreheads.

<center><h3>powers</h3></center>
<p>As a testament to the human brain, Moon Knight's state of mind has always caused his "Powers and Abilities from Khonshu" to come into question, as he himself, at times, is not a reliable source. It's been stated that he may suffer from a madness so powerful it can only be described as magic.

<br />

<br />
<br />
<center><h3>physical strength</h3></center>
<p>Currently, Spector has the strength of a normal human male of his age, height, and build who engages in intensive regular exercise. He could formerly press lift twice his bodyweight; 450 lbs, but since losing his powers he has been routinely weightlifting and is likely stronger. According to the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 1 9, at his strongest, under the light of the full moon, he can lift about 2 tons.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>weaknesses</h3></center>
<p>&#9642; <b>Brain damage/mental illness:</b> While it was initially believed Marc suffered from dissociative identity disorder, it was determined that the different personas he has developed throughout his life are a consequence of having become Khonshu's avatar. Khonshu is said to have four aspects; Pathfinder, Embracer, Defender, and the Watcher of overnight travelers. Spector cycles through these aspects, and his brain applies identities to them in order to explain them. In essence, Marc's mind has been "colonized" by Khonshu, and the different personalities Marc displays are a way to cope with the damage. Despite this, Marc has also been shown to have experienced dissociative episodes from a young age.

<br /> <br />
<center><h3>the trickster</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Loki Laufeyson was the biological son of Laufey, the ruler of the Frost Giants in Jotunheim, who was abandoned and left to die shortly after his birth. Found by Odin, Loki was taken to Asgard and raised by him and Frigga as an Asgardian prince, along with Thor. When Thor was to be crowned King, Loki had sabotaged the coronation by letting the Frost Giants attack Asgard, thus leading Thor to seek vengeance on Jotunheim, which resulted in Thor's banishment to Earth and Loki finding out the truth about his heritage. Frigga gave Loki the throne when Odin had fallen into the Odinsleep; however, when the Warriors Three and Sif attempted to return Thor home, Loki was forced to try to stop them. Regardless, Thor returned from his exile on Earth and ended Loki's reign. With Odin disapproving of his actions, Loki allowed himself to fall through the deep abyss of space, entering a wormhole created by the sudden termination of the Bifrost Bridge.
<p>Transported by the wormhole to Sanctuary, Loki encountered The Other who offered to serve under Thanos' command and gave him the Scepter. Loki was given command over the Chitauri army in order to conquer Earth, under the provision that Loki acquires the Tesseract for Thanos. Once he came to Earth, Loki managed to take possession of the Tesseract and used its power to open a wormhole above New York City and caused the Chitauri Invasion, but all of Loki's schemes were ultimately defeated by the Avengers. Thor returned him to Asgard as his prisoner, where Odin condemned him to spend the rest of his life in the Asgardian Dungeons as punishment for his crimes.
<p>However, when Frigga was killed during the Sacking of Asgard, Loki was freed by Thor in order to defeat the Dark Elves led by Malekith who desired to use the power of the Aether to transform the universe into eternal darkness. During the fight against the Dark Elves in Svartalfheim, Loki faked his death, and, unbeknownst to everyone in the Kingdom, returned to Asgard and successfully removed Odin from the throne, taking his place as King where he remained for several years. During his reign, Loki continued to rule Asgard by sending Sif on missions to Earth to investigate the attacks of Lorelei and Vin-Tak.
<p>Eventually, the return of Thor forced Loki to reveal his deception as the pair journeyed together to find Odin, arriving just in time to witness Odin's death. The loss of Odin allowed Hela, Odin's firstborn, to return from banishment and wage war against the Nine Realms. Loki found himself stranded at Sakaar along with Thor where Loki allied himself with the Grandmaster while Thor was forced to battle against Hulk. Despite trying to manipulate his way to freedom, Loki chose to side with Thor and the Revengers in a final battle against Hela, in which Loki summoned Surtur, who defeated Hela by causing Ragnarök and destroying all of Asgard.
<p>During his final moments on Asgard, Loki took the Tesseract from Odin's Vault and in the wake of the Destruction of Asgard, chose to stay by his brother's side and support his ascension onto the throne. Consequences of his deal with Thanos would soon come back to haunt Loki, however, as the Mad Titan and his Black Order intercepted the Asgardians as they were making their way towards Earth. In the chaos that followed, Loki attempted to kill Thanos but ultimately failed. When Loki taunted Thanos by telling him that he would never be a god, the Mad Titan snapped his neck, finally killing the God of Mischief.
</div>

<br />
<center><h3>personality</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Loki was an ever-scheming individual; the God of Mischief, he meddled in people's lives and even led them to their inevitable deaths as it made him feel powerful, and often used superior ploys or ulterior designs upon his enemies, such as Thor and the Avengers. Compared to his boisterous older brother, he constantly seemed to be relaxed, peaceful and quiet, but in truth had the mind of a cold, calculating sociopath and was formulating machinations that would achieve his power and respect that he truly believed he deserves at all times. Other than that, Loki supposedly cared for Thor, consoling him after his coronation was ruined but was stated to be envious of him his entire life, although no one knew the extent of such envy until it was too late. He had a deep hatred of Odin and Thor due to supposedly being the least favored son and rejected by Thor himself all the time. Loki would do anything to mortify, defeat or hurt Thor, even enslaving the world he cared for and supposedly taking his own life.
<p>Part of his bitterness stemmed from the fact that he was a Frost Giant and was intended as a political tool to bring peace between Asgardians and Frost Giants. As such, Loki felt alienated and guilty since he was a member of a race Asgardians were taught to fear and hate, and the people he thought were his family fibbed to him about it all his life. Growing up, Loki believed he was an actual prince of Asgard and so genuinely thought he could be king. Loki competed with Thor for Odin's favor, yet once his real parentage was revealed, Loki felt betrayed as he felt a Frost Giant as king was never a feasible possibility. And what’s more, Loki felt that he was viewed as nothing more than a trophy and tool instead of an actual son by Odin despite all evidence to the contrary.
<p>However, deep down, Loki loved his family to some degree. Though his hatred for his brother and father seemed to be unending, he did not share these feelings for his mother Frigga. Upon learning she was killed, Loki acted with madness and eliminated everything within his cell. When he got confronted by Thor in his imprisonment, he asked genuinely if she suffered as she died and was ready to work with his much-hated brother to kill Malekith. Part of this stemmed from his regret over directing Kurse to Frigga and Jane Foster and upon Svartalfheim he displayed tremendous and uncharacteristic selflessness such as risking his own life to save Foster and Thor while dying in the process. Thor even stated that Loki indeed died with honor but even this was a ruse as he has usurped the throne of Asgard and captured Odin. Despite his hatred and contempt, Loki would have expressed the desire to be Thor's equal and recognized by Odin as the worthy son. He seemed to care about the two of them to an extent, particularly Odin, calling the guards and looking on in concern when Odin collapsed on the ground, and while he was hanging onto Thor near the Bifrost, he stated that he wanted to destroy Jotunheim for him. Perhaps, he loved his family deep down as he appeared hesitant to eject Thor out of the Helicarrier, and saved Odin from being murdered by Laufey as he later stated that his death was not his goal, and did not actually kill Odin, but rather imprisoned him on Earth.
<p>But the love he once showed and his more human emotions appeared to be significantly dulled by the time he arrived on Earth, along with the decades of built-up resentment which overshadowed any sliver of humanity Loki might retain. Despite this, however, Loki's time as king of Asgard appeared to have reduced his rivalry with and hatred for Thor and resentment for Odin, as he showed sadness and remorse for Odin's death and even showed visible care for Thor on Sakaar, asking him not to return to Asgard out of possible concern of his adopted brother dying against Hela. He was evidently angry and distraught when Thor ignored his offers to abandon Asgard and join the Grandmaster, saying emotionally that he always had to do it alone. He was also affected when Thor suggested he remain on Sakaar due to his power-hungry nature and seemed saddened when Thor said that their paths had diverged long ago. Ultimately, Loki's newfound love for his brother swayed him to help Thor evacuate the Asgardians, risk his life by personally reviving Surtur, and support Thor's coronation.
<p>He had suppressed his desires for most of his life due to constantly living within Thor's shadow. As such he was capable of presenting himself as timid and meek when in reality he was in possession of supreme megalomaniacal ambitions which he believed he was entitled to more than anyone else, especially Thor whom he viewed as an incompetent fool who would make a terrible King in comparison to himself. As The Other stated, his desires were virtually reminiscent to that of a childish need to always be best; this also made his hatred of Thor an entirely overgrown and impractical sibling rivalry and the entirety of his actions could be intervened as purely attention-seeking, going to horrifying lengths such as the subjugation or destruction of a species, all to impress his father. Indeed, Loki's megalomaniacal desires were foiled by his true objective to stand superior over Thor and crush him completely, proving to Thor that he was his equal and his better, which was all he ever wanted.
<p>As a master of deceit and trickery, Loki utilized his duplicitous nature within combat. Loki was also not above underhanded tactics, such as when Thor offered a hand of peace, Loki deceptively stabbed him in his side. Loki would create feints and appear like running away or surrendering if a fight turned to his disadvantage. For example, when he was at the mercy of Thor on top of the Bifrost Bridge, Loki pathetically begged for his life, yet revealed the act to be just another one of his illusion manipulations and a feint to ambush his brother. However, Loki had a flaw of being arrogant, narcissistic and was in possession of extensive delusions of self-entitlement. This led him into trouble at times as he mocked Hulk within Avengers Tower, calling him a "dull creature" which caused him to be thrashed around like a plaything by the green monster. Later, the same arrogance allowed Doctor Strange sufficient time to teleport Loki away from the New York Sanctum. This overconfidence over his deceptive talents ultimately ended up claiming his life as attempted to smooth talk Thanos into lowering his guard enough to be slain only for the Titan to easily anticipate the attack and inevitable betrayal, having always been the far better deceiver and manipulator, and kill Loki in retaliation.
<p>He had an unfounded superiority over and deep hatred for humans, and this enforced his thinking that he was entitled to rule them; simply because he could, due to mankind's history of following people with power, Loki simply believed that they would view him as a benevolent dictator instead. Added to this, Loki firmly believed that freedom was life's great lie and that no-one was truly free and everyone was oppressed in some way. He went as far to say that humans were created only to be subjugated by superior men and that they craved to have a ruler, claiming that they would be lost and their lives effectively pointless without one to give them their identity. He mocked Thor for his compassion towards humanity and him enslaving Earth would be nothing less than a petty, spiteful attack towards his older brother.
<p>For many years, Loki had no respect for his real heritage and would often contradict himself within this area to whatever situation would require it better. After learning that Laufey was in actuality his biological father, he did not even mention this to him on Jotunheim and later murdered him when he attempted to kill Odin. He called the Frost Giants a "race of monsters" despite already knowing that he was a member of the race himself before unleashing the full power of the Bifrost upon their planet. Effectively ending the war which Thor started and having saved Odin's life, he believed would be paraded as a hero as he apparently could not see the logic that ending an entire race would only make Odin disgust him further. Since learning that he was the son of Laufey, Loki stated that Thor was not his brother at all, ignoring the years that they grew up together entirely and threw this in his face twice. When hanging over the Bifrost, though, he referred to him as "brother", despite having previously disowned him only a few minutes earlier, though this was soon revealed to be an illusion, and another trick to use against Thor. Likewise, after being transported to Earth by the Tesseract he claimed himself as "Loki of Asgard" but on Svartalfheim before the Dark Elves, proclaimed himself "Loki of Jotunheim".
<p>The Battle of New York traumatized Loki, since his defeats at the hands of Hulk left him terrified about the creature, to the extent of trying to leave Sakaar upon discovering that Hulk was the champion of their Contest of Champions. Despite this, Loki showed to be capable of using him, as when he, Thor and Valkyrie plotted how to get Thor out of Sakaar, Loki suggested to use Hulk. When the Statesman came under attack by Thanos, however, the two had formed enough of a partnership to improvise a coordinated attack on the Mad Titan. Indeed Bruce Banner would later insist on referring to the New York invasion as Thanos' doing instead of Loki's, emphasizing how the two had come to terms.
<p>Shortly after Odin died and Thor learned the truth about Hela and how Asgard really rose to power, Loki genuinely felt sympathetic towards Thor as he had just found out that everything he knew was false, much like how Loki himself did after finding out he was a Frost Giant. After the destruction of Asgard, Loki and Thor seem to have fully reconciled. However, Loki still kept some of his mischiefs as he stole the Tesseract from Odin's Vault before Asgard’s destruction. Ultimately, though, seeing Thanos on the brink of killing Thor, Loki gave up the Tesseract, despite the fact that it allowed the Titan to be one step closer to conquering the universe, showing his love for his brother had now far surpassed any desire for power that Loki had, but Loki did so in an attempt to assassinate Thanos. Unfortunately for Loki, Thanos easily anticipated this and killed him.
<p>An often remarked flaw of Loki's was that he not only lacked conviction but often failed to appreciate the long term consequences his actions might have as stated by Phil Coulson and Iron Man shortly before the Battle of New York. This was seen again following his usurping of Odin's throne as his decadent leadership caused most of the Nine Realms to fall into chaos and unintentionally precipitated Hela's release. This period of total power had also given him a sense of complacency to the point where most everyone he came across had come to anticipate all of his potential tricks and betrayals. Indeed, Thor openly mocking this attitude was a deciding factor in Loki's decision to reform his ways and genuinely aid his people.
<p>In the final moments of his life, Loki displayed that he truly came to accept both his Asgardian heritage and his Frost Giant parentage, proudly identifying himself as "Odinson" and the "rightful king of Jotunheim". Though having lived in fear of Thanos since their first meeting, Loki selflessly attempted to slay the Titan in spite of his power and entourage, showing he had truly redeemed himself. When Thanos effortlessly parried the attack and began choking Loki to death, Loki not only accepted his fate but remained openly defiant, ridiculing Thanos that he would never achieve true godhood. In the end, Loki died doing what many believed he would never do: display open care for others and reconcile with and accept his lineage.

<center><h3>powers &amp; ablities</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>As a Frost Giant, Loki possessed superhuman attributes such as abnormal strength, speed, agility, durability, stamina, and reflexes and had been shown to be a powerful combatant. He learned to use Asgardian sorcery from Frigga, which, in addition to his cunning, manipulative and strategic mind, made Loki one of the most dangerous foes an individual could ever face in battle. Thor told Doctor Strange that Loki is "a worthy inclusion" to the latter's watchlist of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to Earth.
<p><b>Frost Giant Physiology:</b> Since Loki had been enchanted to look like an Asgardian, Loki's Frost Giant features only came out when he was in contact with Frost Giant magic, such as when he utilized the Casket of Ancient Winters or when he was afflicted with the Frost Giants' touch. Though he is surpassed in physical capabilities by Asgardians, he can easily overpower grown men such as Tony Stark and keep up with enhanced individuals such as Captain America.
<br />
<br />
<p>&#9642; <b>superhuman strength:</b> Loki possessed considerable superhuman strength, allowing him to overpower multiple S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and Captain America with little effort, easily defeat multiple Frost Giants, Dark Elves and Berserkers, effortlessly lifted Tony Stark off his feet and threw him, and even handled an Infinity Stone without being harmed. He threw one of his knives with enough force to break through a Frost Giant's ice weapon. However, Loki's strength is still outclassed by that of Thor, the Hulk, and Thanos. Although he was able to fight Valkyrie on nearly equal grounds by matching her strength with his own skill, speed, and agility before she overpowered him, he was completely unable to resist Thanos, who effortlessly overpowered and lifted him off his feet with no strain even as Loki struggled to break free. He was also unable to fight Hulk, who effortlessly lifted him off his feet and repeatedly pummeled and defeated him within seconds. When wielding the Scepter, which contained an Infinity Stone, and Gungnir, Loki managed to go toe-to-toe with a Mjolnir-wielding Thor in a fight, albeit he was ultimately defeated even when Thor was holding back.
<p>&#9642; <b>superhuman durability:</b> Loki had shown himself to be highly resistant to physical harm, further augmented by his armor. Hence, Loki only flinched after getting shot in the face multiple times with a handgun and was not at all affected by assault rifle rounds to his torso. Loki also barely reacted to a jab to the face from Captain America, and even a full force kick to the face from the latter that made Loki stumble back only hurt him slightly. He could even withstand the explosion of the energy of the Rainbow Bridge with no damage. However, sufficiently powerful weapons, such as Iron Man's repulsors, Hawkeye's explosive arrows, and a deflected shot from his own Scepter, were at least able to cause Loki pain and leave minor marks. Loki's durability was implied to be far greater than that of a normal Frost Giant, as he was able to take multiple mighty blows from Valkyrie, and even Hulk and Thor without any fatal damage. In addition, as a Frost Giant, Loki was immune to the extreme cold of Jotunheim. He also managed to safely touch the Tesseract without being harmed and even endure Thanos's grip on his neck long enough to defiantly threaten him that he will never be a god, although he quickly died. However, Loki's endurance and durability were shown to be considerably lesser than that of Thor, as seen when Loki was completely wiped out by Hulk's attack, yet Thor managed to recover from the same attack moments later, without any visible injuries and this was later shown when Thor survived being badly beaten and even having his head squeezed by Thanos while Loki was easily killed by Thanos when he snapped his neck without any effort. He could also survive in the vacuum of space unfazed.
<p>&#9642; <b>superhuman speed:</b> Loki's inferior strength compared to Thor was compensated for his superhuman speed; he was fast enough to catch Hawkeye's arrow in mid-flight, inches away from his neck. He also used his speed in his fight against Captain America, during which he easily gained the upper hand, even smashing Captain America's Shield to the ground. Loki's speed even allowed him to contend with stronger opponents, such as Valkyrie and Thor, by outmaneuvering them, though he still ultimately lost such fights and Thor was holding back against Loki each and every time they fought and once Loki angered his brother in their second fight, Thor was able to easily catch Loki off-guard and beat him without Loki being able to react, implying Loki's speed is inferior to Thor when Thor held nothing back. Loki was also fast enough to tackle his brother out of the way before Hulk ambushed Thanos. 
<p>&#9642; <b>superhuman agility:</b> Loki had shown immense agility and reflexes, defeating several Dark Elves at once by using swift and agile movements, and keeping up with the stronger Valkyrie for the majority of their fight with his agility, though Loki was ultimately defeated and chained up, as well as going toe-to-toe with Thor, albeit Thor was holding back, despite the latter's own great agility and fighting ability, in both of their fights.
<p>&#9642; <b>superhuman stamina:</b> Loki possessed superhuman stamina that allowed him to fight prolonged battles.
<p>&#9642; <b>superhuman reflexes:</b> Loki possesses superhuman reaction time and reflexes. During the Battle of New York, Loki he managed to catch an arrow shot by Hawkeye when it was in the mid-flight without looking.
<p>&#9642; <b>regenerative healing factor:</b> Despite his astounding resistance to injury, it was still possible to injure or even kill Loki. However, due to his Frost Giant physiology, Loki healed at a rate much faster than that of humans. Hence, Loki was quickly recovered back on his feet even after being brutally smashed multiple times against the ground by Hulk.
<p>&#9642; <b>longevity:</b> Loki had the capacity to live for thousands of years. He was a baby in 965 A.D. and lived up to 2018 while retaining a younger appearance.
<p>&#9642; <b>ice manipulation:</b> Not long after learning of his Jotun blood, Loki discovered an ability to create and manipulate ice, which he used to freeze the Bifrost in place when trying to destroy Jotunheim.
<p>&#9642; <b>cold immunity:</b> Due to his Frost Giant physiology, Loki was immune to the otherwise cold and damaging touch of Frost Giants. He was unharmed when Raze grabbed him, whereas Volstagg was injured by the physical contact from a Jotunn. In fact, both a Frost Giant's touch and his, either using or even touching the Casket of Ancient Winters, would reveal his true form as a Frost Giant.
<br />
<br />
<p><b>master sorcerer:</b> Loki learned how to wield Asgardian magic while growing up in Asgard, thanks to his adoptive mother Frigga. He eventually became an extremely skilled and formidable sorcerer, with it being his main asset in battle, though other exceptionally skilled sorcerers, like Doctor Strange could contend with him. Even Odin was impressed by Loki's magical skills and noted that Frigga would have been proud of him.

<p>&#9642; <b>illusion manipulation:</b> Loki could generate extremely detailed images from outside himself, which are perceptible in the external world, sometimes with a gesture. His holographic illusions could be projected across entire rooms, which allowed him to disguise the fact that he was disheveled and had destroyed his cell in the Asgardian Dungeons in anger over Frigga's death, though Thor was able to deduce the illusion quickly. However, Loki most notably conjured up the extremely convincing illusion of him seemingly dying from a wound inflicted by Kurse.
<p>&#9642; <b>duplication casting:</b> Loki could recreate an exact facsimile of one's own body, which acted as a true holographic mirror of its molecular structure in its present circumstance. He was particularly noted to fool enemies who try to attack him with an illusion of himself. These projections cannot interact with the environment and when someone attempts to interact with it, they will phase through it and the projections will give a green glow around wherever it was touched. Thor was noted to fall for this ability numerous times. Loki can even produce multiple images of himself appear simultaneously during a duel with Thor before the latter blasted them away with a blast of lightning. He could also use this ability to project himself into other locations, similarly to astral projection, through which he can perceive and communicate with others. He may have used this method to speak Thor when the latter was imprisoned by Phil Coulson after failing to pick up his hammer, instantly appearing in and then disappearing from the sealed room Thor was kept in. While in possession of the Scepter, Loki could project himself far across the universe to speak with The Other and was able to feel when the latter touched his projection’s face. Whilst Thor was imprisoned on Sakaar, he would send an illusion of himself to try and convince Thor to work with him in his future scheme to betray the Grandmaster. Being more wary of his brother’s duplicitous antics, Thor managed to recognize Loki leaving a decoy of himself in his place as the pair were walking side by side while he attempted to sneak away from him. 
<p>&#9642; <b>presence concealment:</b> Loki was able to render himself and others unseen and unheard to whomever he wanted. This effect could be achieved both through him creating the illusion of letting light waves pass through himself or as simply a trick of the mind, similar to hypnosis. He could even mask his presence from the all-seeing Heimdall himself while he was in Jotunheim, sneak several Frost Giants into Asgard without Heimdall's notice, and hide from S.H.I.E.L.D. agents when he briefly visited Thor and attempted to lift Mjølnir himself. Also, he appeared as a reflection in a mirror without being present in a room, while no one noticed him, as he even spoke aloud and neither Erik Selvig nor Nick Fury heard him, though this may have been at least partly accomplished through the use of the Scepter to astrally project himself to the location as he subliminally influenced Selvig. Using two illusory decoys of himself, one to lure Thor into the holding cell on the Helicarrier previously containing him and another to distract Thor and Phil Coulson, Loki managed to lurk behind the latter despite otherwise being in full view of Thor before fatally stabbing Coulson and revealing himself.
<p>&#9642; <b>shapeshifting:</b> Loki was able to alter his attire, his voice, and his physical appearance in order to resemble another person or animal. When Loki uses this power on an entire person, the light generated is green, whereas if it is used on only part of a person or their clothing, the light appears yellow. He used this power to change his clothing from his usual armor to a human's business suit, and back to his battle armor. He was also capable of imitating Thor, Captain America, Odin, and an anonymous Asgardian guard. Loki's shapeshifting was so skilled that even as a child, he was able to transform himself into a snake to trick Thor, with his disguise being convincing enough to allow Thor to pick him up and hold him without arousing suspicion. He can also change others appearances as he briefly turned Thor into a frog as well as making him look like Lady Sif, and later on, to appear as if he had been stabbed, beaten and missing a hand when tricking Malekith into thinking that he had attacked Thor. Loki's shapeshifting also allowed him to generate weapons and armor as well, such as when he turned himself into an Asgardian Guard, he generated a spear and armor. Loki also used this power to generate a dagger in an attempt to assassinate Thanos. Loki's shapeshifting could not free him of any restraints placed upon him, as when he transformed into Captain America to mock him, Loki's hands were still bound, although he made it appear that the restraints had vanished.
<p>&#9642; <b>mental manipulation:</b> Loki could subtly influence the minds of others, such as when he manipulated Erik Selvig into researching the Tesseract, making him repeat his words and thoughts as if they were his own. Later, Loki was even able to cast such a spell on Odin himself, which induced the All-Father to stay on Midgard while Loki usurped his Asgardian throne for four years, though it should be noted that the spell's effects were ultimately not permanent and Odin was able to break the spell shortly before Ragnarök, and only choose to remain in exile due to his impending death. Loki's illusions could also take the form of entire vivid visions, such as when he notably forced Valkyrie to relive her day of defeat against Hela by placing his hand on her head, something he was able to perceive.
<p>&#9642; <b>conjuration:</b> Loki was able to cause objects to appear or disappear according to his will, oftentimes those he had previously acquired. When Heimdall was about to attack him, Loki quickly summoned the Casket of Ancient Winters to use against him, then made it disappear with a wave of his hands. He also appeared to be able to summon his dual daggers out of thin air when threatening Doctor Strange. Later, he used this ability to summon a dagger to throw at Hela while in the Bifrost. Finally, he used this ability to make the Tesseract appear in his hand when presenting it to Thanos.
<p>&#9642; <b>telekinesis:</b> Loki was influence objects and move matter with mere gestures and focus. Upon hearing of Frigga's death, Loki, in a fury, clenched his fists and sent nearly everything around the cell flying through the air and crashing into the walls, which also shook the cell violently like a small tremor, causing the light in it to flicker like an electromagnetic pulse.
<p>&#9642; <b>genius-level intellect:</b> Loki was very intelligent, particularly in the fields of sorcery, tactics, manipulation, and deception, ranking as among the most intelligent individuals in the universe, being highly formidable even without using his powers or combat skills but simply through sheer intelligence, although while holding incredible intelligence, he was still way surpassed by someone as intelligent as Thanos's, with the latter thus easily completely deceiving and manipulating Loki into becoming his henchmen without him even realizing it for a long time and Loki would ultimately meet his true end when he attempted to fool and kill Thanos, who easily outsmarted Loki yet again, casually deflecting Loki's assassination attempt and then killing him without Loki being able to use his intelligence to survive the encounter. Also, Loki was initially noticeably superior to Thor in intelligence, repeatedly outsmarting him, but Thor would eventually manage to anticipate and outsmart Loki. Hence, despite lacking scientific expertise, he was able to understand and eventually utilize alien technologies with great proficiency, such as when he used a Midgard eye remover on Heinrich Schafer, when learned to use the control console that controlled the cage on Nick Fury's Helicarrier, and when he piloted both a Chitauri and Sakaaran airships. One of Loki's biggest achievements was successfully outsmarting and killing the almost invincible and vastly stronger Kurse, whom Loki tricked into letting him get close enough to activate his opponent's own Black Hole Grenade, a strategy which neither Kurse saw through until it was too late or Thor had thought of who unsuccessfully attempted to beat him hand-to-hand. 
<p>&#9642; <b>master tactician:</b> Loki was a crafty genius in orchestrating cunning schemes, that had earned him the title of 'God of Mischief'. Hence, Loki successfully orchestrated the events that lead to the banishment and death of Thor, by making Laufey and the Frost Giants attack Asgard during Thor's coronation, only to betray them and gain Asgard's throne. He later allowed himself to be captured by the Avengers and had his brainwashed ally Hawkeye attack Nick Fury's Helicarrier, and provoke Hulk into a rage, thereby freeing himself and separating the superhero team. Later, Loki helped Thor in the latter's attempt to destroy the Reality Stone by pretending to betray him in full view of Malekith and Kurse, thereby momentarily gaining the Dark Elves' trust. Shortly thereafter, Loki successfully faked his own death, cast a hypnosis spell against Odin, and finally usurped the Asgardian throne for four years. After later being marooned on Sakaar, Loki managed to gain the Grandmaster's trust with relative ease. However, his incredible tactical abilities are still far surpassed by Thanos, as the latter was able to easily anticipate Loki's attempt to assassinate him and then successfully finish him off for good.
<p>&#9642; <b>expert combatant:</b> Even though Loki was far more interested in sorcery than Asgardian warrior arts, he was still a highly skilled and formidable hand-to-hand combatant, having received extensive training in unarmed combat as well as having centuries of combat experience. His skills had allowed him to effortlessly defeat and kill several S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives in mere seconds, to easily kill several Frost Giants in Jotunheim, to easily slay multiple Dark Elves at once, using only a dagger, to defeat many Berserkers, and to roughly overpower the extremely skilled Captain America in a duel, although the latter proved to have more combat skills than that of his own. He has even been able to hold his own well against the stronger Valkyrie (through his superior agility), and even Thor on several occasions, who were among the most skilled warriors in Asgard's history, though Thor later admitted to having held back against his adopted brother.
<p>&#9642; <b>knife mastery:</b> Loki was highly skilled at using knives in combat, being able to easily kill several Frost Giants and Dark Elves with a single dagger. He was also highly skilled in knife throwing, as he accurately threw a knife into a Frost Giant as well as throwing two blades into the necks of two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents at once.
<p>&#9642; <b>spear mastery:</b> Loki was extremely skilled at using a spear in combat, being able to contend with Thor using Mjølnir wielding Gungnir in their ferocious duel. He also wielded the Scepter with devastating efficiency, effortlessly killing many S.H.I.E.L.D operatives and once again going toe-to-toe with Thor using his hammer.
<p>&#9642; <b>expert marksman:</b> Loki was a highly skilled marksman who could wield different types of weapons with great accuracy. He used Gungnir to shoot and kill his father, Laufey. After being given the Scepter by Thanos, Loki used it to fire energy blasts with devastating accuracy. During the Destruction of Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. and the Battle of New York Loki shot air crafts out of the sky with only one shot using the Scepter. Loki was also highly skilled in knife throwing. During the Attack on Jotunheim and Destruction of Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. Loki killed several Frost Giants and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents by throwing knives at them. Loki was able to gun down several Sakaaran Guards with a Sakaaran Laser Rifle with little effort during the Escape from Sakaar despite not being known to use a gun.
<p>&#9642; <b>pilot:</b> Loki was a capable pilot, claiming to be better than Thor, able to effectively fly numerous alien spaceships, including a Chitauri Chariot, an Asgardian Skiff and the Commodore by himself.
<p>&#9642; <b>Multilingualism:</b> Loki was fluent in his native Asgardian, Norwegian, Latin, and English.

<center><h3>trivia</h3></center>
<p>&#9642; It was once speculated that given Loki's god-like appearance and lack of Giant features, his mother was possibly a goddess and not a giantess
<p><div id="hc">&#9642; Loki was very intelligent, particularly in the fields of sorcery, tactics, manipulation, and deception, ranking as among the most intelligent individuals in the universe, being highly formidable even without using his powers or combat skills but simply through sheer intelligence, although while holding incredible intelligence, he was still way surpassed by someone as intelligent as Thanos's, with the latter thus easily completely deceiving and manipulating Loki into becoming his henchmen without him even realizing it for a long time and Loki would ultimately meet his true end when he attempted to fool and kill Thanos, who easily outsmarted Loki yet again, casually deflecting Loki's assassination attempt and then killing him without Loki being able to use his intelligence to survive the encounter.</div>
<p>&#9642; Since Loki had been enchanted to look like an Asgardian, Loki's Frost Giant features only came out when he was in contact with Frost Giant magic, such as when he utilized the Casket of Ancient Winters or when he was afflicted with the Frost Giants' touch. Though he is surpassed in physical capabilities by Asgardians, he can easily overpower grown men such as Tony Stark and keep up with enhanced individuals such as Captain America. 
<p>&#9642; Loki learned how to wield Asgardian magic while growing up in Asgard, thanks to his adoptive mother Frigga. He eventually became an extremely skilled and formidable sorcerer, with it being his main asset in battle, though other exceptionally skilled sorcerers, like Doctor Strange could contend with him. Even Odin was impressed by Loki's magical skills and noted that Frigga would have been proud of him. 
<p>&#9642; While Loki was far more interested in sorcery than Asgardian warrior arts, he had still proven to have received highly extensive combat training that makes him a surprisingly formidable fighter in both armed and hand-to-hand combat.

<p>&#9642; <b>base of operations:</b> gotham and nanda parbat 
<br /> <br />
<p>One of the world’s greatest spymasters, Talia al Ghul is a woman perpetually caught between the visions of the two most important men in her life: her father, Ra’s al Ghul, and her Beloved, Batman.
<p>“Talia,” as the Demon’s Daughter has simply been called for most of her history, has lived an extremely gendered life. Born into the highest echelon of the ancient and patriarchal League of Assassins, Talia could have had all the power in the world if not for the unfortunate happenstance of being born a woman.
<p>A peerless fighter and martial artist who possesses a keen mind for both strategy and tactics, Talia was nonetheless led to believe that the only way to secure the power lost to her by birth was to find a suitable male partner and produce a son. Yet, having accomplished both romance with her ideal man and the birth of a perfect heir, Talia was still left wanting. It was not until the Demon’s Daughter took her destiny into her own hands, forming the clandestine criminal empire known as Leviathan, that Talia al Ghul at last became something more powerful than even her venerable father could imagine.
<br />
<br />

<center><h3>early life</h3></center>
<p>In her youth, Talia travelled the world with her father learning and adapting his intellect and skills which she proves to be more competent than any of Ghul's other children. She excels to the point in managing his criminal and legitimate operations, that she is eventually appointed as Ghul's primary secondary despite the fact that Ghul considers women to be inherently inferior to men. Ghul is supportive of his daughter though has commented that if possible, he would correct "that sole failing" in his child suggesting that he fears any possible distortion of her through chemical or biological modifications despite his aversion to her as a woman.
<br /><br />

<center><h3>batman</h3></center>
<p>Talia first meets Batman when he rescues her from Dr. Darrk, apparently the leader of the League of Assassins. It is eventually revealed that the League is just one part of Ra's al Ghul's organization, The Demon, and that Darrk apparently turned against Ra's after failing in a mission (the usual punishment for this being death). At the end of the story, she shoots and kills Darrk to save Batman's life.
<p>When Robin (Dick Grayson) is kidnapped, Ra's al Ghul enters the Batcave, revealing to Batman that he knows Batman's secret identity and claims that Talia was also kidnapped along with Dick. Batman then goes with Ra's to search for Dick and Talia; it is revealed that the kidnapping was a setup designed by Ra's as a final test of whether or not Batman is suitable as an heir. Over the years however Talia has proven an important 'ally' in her way; most prominently, she encourages Batman to return to Gotham City when it is declared a "No Man's Land" following an earthquake, and he has lost his fighting spirit and didn't believe he could save Gotham.
<br /><br />

<center><h3>the red hood</h3></center>
<p>After Jason Todd's death at the hands of the Joker, Batman brought his body back to Gotham and buried him with the rest of the Wayne Family. However, several years later, during The Infinite Crisis, Superboy Prime trying to change reality, resurrects Jason with a reality-altering punch. Although Jason is returned to life, his body and mind are still broken from the Joker's attack. Some time later, he is discovered by the League of Assassins.Out of her love for Batman, Talia takes Jason to her father and Jason spends months in the care of the League of Assassins. Although his body recuperates, Jason's mind is shattered..
<p>Seeing no other way to help him, Talia takes Jason down to the Lazarus Pit and throws his body in while her father regenerates himself. Jason is fully revived in body and mind. Immediately afterward, in order to spare Jason her father's wrath, she aids the boy's escape.
<p>Livid at the fact that the Joker was still alive and that Batman had done nothing more than imprison him again, Jason pursues his own brand of justice. In order to stall him from killing Batman, Talia agrees to finance Jason and aid him in his training, so that he can become the second Red Hood.
<br /><br />

<center><h3>characteristics</h3></center>
<p>At first glance, she comes off as cold, calculating and discerning; much like her father. She makes no effort to show trivial warming to newcomers and she often despises most people she meets from the very first meeting. Her hard exterior is no doubt attributed to the strict and disciplined nature of her upbringing through Ra’s’ League and the various hardships she has endured throughout her life. She trusts very few people, and much of her actions are strengthened by the ideal that the only person she can rely on is herself.
<p>She is fiercely independent and protective of her feelings, but at the same time, has shown immense levels of heart. Her relationship with Bruce is incredibly unpredictable, but the bottom line has been shown on very many occasions that she still deeply cares for him.
<p>Talia is even more fiercely loyal to Damian, going to great lengths to ensure his protection; especially from Ra’s. Talia has turned on many of her allies in order to ensure Damian is safe and grows with a safe lifestyle. Despite early disagreement, she seems satisfied with leaving him in Bruce’s care.
<p>Despite all her motherly loyalty, Talia is still an incredibly deadly woman with years of hardened experience and no qualms about killing. She has shown time and time again that trust is a silent killer.
<p>talia can also be considered an athlete at the peak of physical conditioning and has been trained in many forms of martial arts. she also has a high intelligence, having advanced degrees in biology, engineering, and business as an mba. she’s quite proficient with most weapons and when it comes to hand to hand combant she is most often underestimated.
<br />
<p>&#9642; <b>longevity &amp; slow aging:</b> Talia is a regular human with no superpowers. Repeated exposure to Lazarus Pits has left her in peak physical form, perhaps as advanced as Bruce or the other elite heroes from Gotham. The pits have also increased her life span.
<p>&#9642; <b>businesswoman:</b> Talia possesses an excellent head for business.
<p>&#9642; <b>advanced martial artist &amp; hand-to-hand combat:</b> Due to her training, Talia is a master of both armed and unarmed combat. Her weapons knowledge extends from simple weapons to advanced modern weapons. She is also a master tactician, which has been necessary in her dealings in crime and espionage.
<p>&#9642; <b>high intellect:</b> Talia has a high intelligence. 
<p>&#9642; <b>master manipulator:</b> She is capable of controlling certain victims to her whim and is quite convincing and persuasive.

<center><h3>trivia</h3></center>
<p>&#9642; The exact history of Talia has not been revealed thus far. In several alternate realities it is explained how Ra's al Ghul met her mother, who was of mixed Chinese and Arab descent, at the Woodstock Festival. Talia's mother later died of a drug overdose. That version was contrast to the early history which stated that Talia's mother was named Melisande and was murdered by a former servant of Ra's named Qayin.  
<p>&#9642; Ra's al Ghul successfully enlisted Batman's aid in defeating a rogue assassin who had murdered his wife. Batman was nearly killed protecting Talia from an attack by the assassin's agents. Talia gave birth successfully. The child was left at an orphanage; he was adopted and given the name Ibn al Xu'ffasch. The only clue to the child's heritage was a jewel-encrusted necklace that was given to Talia which Talia then left with the child.

<center><h3>headcanons</h3></center>
<p><div id="hc">&#9642; <b>ptsd:</b> thanks to nyssa using her artificially created pit to kill talia and revive her over and over again, she suffers from post traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). her symptoms tend to come out after a stressful event, showing in the nightmares that plague her sleep. sometimes it will take something as simple as a car backfiring to trigger flashbacks of her sister shooting her over and over again before pushing her into the pit. she won’t admit that she has a problem as that would be seen as weak. anyone who is close to her will see that she suffers from something but unless she tells them about what nyssa did to her no one knows just what it is she suffers from.</div>
<p><div id="hc">&#9642; <b>love:</b> love is not something talia feels. she was never shown love growing up and never knew just what it was supposed to be. while she does still love bruce it isn’t something that a normal person would consider love. the same can be said about the love she has for damian. having had no maternal figure in her life she tried her best to be a mother to her son. the love she has for him is closer to a natural love than that she holds for bruce. love also isn’t something she feels she’s capable of giving because of everything that has happened in her life. though a part of her would love the chance to find someone she could love and share her life with.</div>
<p><div id="hc"><b>languages:</b> talia tends to speak english most often. she knows french, spanish, italian, arabic and mandarin though mandarin isn’t one she’s fluent in as she learned it to honour her mother. all of the other languages she learned during her childhood because of the tutors her father hired to teach her. due to the amount of time she spent in london she has a heavy english accent and will sometimes use certain phrases common to those from england. arabic is something she uses during those times she visits ra’s. all the others are those she uses while she’s handling her business affairs.</div>
<p><div id="hc"><b>education &amp; business:</b>ra’s al ghul made certain that talia had all the best tutors he could find. during the first ten years of her life she was taught a myriad of things such foreign languages, math, science, and grammar lessons. he also made certain she was given a music teacher so that she had that knowledge when he found her a proper suitor. after the age of ten she was sent to london along with a small group of trusted league members to finish her education. ra’s expected her to return home once she was done with her education but finding out she was accepted into a prestigious university he allowed her to stay under one condition; she returned back to the fold once she was done.
<p>she did, of course, and was matched with bruce wayne. it wasn’t what she’d wanted in life and after producing the heir ra’s wanted she once again focused on her education and future. unfortunately, she waited until damian was safe in bruce’s hands before applying to and being accepted to cambridge’s business school. it was during this time that she came up with the concept of rastech industries. talia originally came up with it for a project during her time at school but once she graduated she decided to create the company. now, it’s on the verge of becoming an international company known for helping those in the third world get access clean water as well as offer microloans.</div>
<p><div id="hc">&#9642; <b>fighting &amp; weaponry:</b>talia is an expert with a sword and with daggers in close combat. while she is also capable of hand to hand fighting, she prefers to use a weapon. her training came from her time growing up around the league. ra’s made certain she could handle herself and she took it one step further and decided to allow the members of the league to train her. like all of those who went through their training she completed it by killing one of her classmates and earned the mark that all members have on their bodies.
<p>when she’s out and about in gotham (or any other city) talia tends to carry two knives, one of which will kill someone with just one slice. during her time under ra’s tutelage she created a poison that has no known antidote. she is the only one who will survive getting cut by this particular blade as she worked to create it in the first place. anyone who ends up cut by it will die a slow, painful death; something she wanted when she originally created it. and every month she tends to re-coat the blade to make certain it hasn’t lost its effectiveness.</div>
<p><div id="hc">&#9642; <b>ra's al ghul:</b> even though ra’s is her father, she doesn’t see him as such. he was rarely there for her growing up, using her as a pawn in his game. while he made certain she had the best tutors and the best trainers he was never the sort of person she would ever call father. ra’s never saw her as anything else but a pawn and talia knew she would never be good enough for him. she worked hard, she survived the training that all those who went into the league went through and even then she was still never good enough for him. he was cold, he was calculating and all he wanted from her was the ability to have an heir. ra’s also wanted someone who could take over the league from him.
<p>after forcing bruce to leave her, after leaving her son with the man she loved, talia made a point of taking her father down once and for all. her plan with nyssa had succeeded in an odd sort of way and yet ra’s still managed to survive. that showed her that she needed to be smarter than her father and instead of using her physical prowess against him, she went to business school and used those particular skills to beat her father. one day she does hope to take over the league. but until then she will use all her skills to improve the world.</div>
<p><div id="hc">&#9642; <b>nyssa:</b> while nyssa is talia’s half-sister, their relationship is anything but. she never knew of nyssa growing up and once she found out she wasn’t certain what to feel for her. ra’s had never been a loving father and her mother had died young so finding out she had another sibling had come as quite the shock. as much as she wanted to accept nyssa for who she was, in her mind it was yet one more obstacle on her path to taking over the league from her father. though, they did find ways of working together she never fully trusted her sister.
<p>and like she assumed nyssa proved to her why she shouldn’t be trusted. ra’s was the only one she knew to have lazarus pits and growing up she knew they had to be in certain locations around the world. nyssa had somehow found a way of recreating them and had kidnapped talia knowing what would happen when one used them. over and over again she died, the pit bringing her back to life and leaving its mark on her. she knew why nyssa was doing it and knew that it was the only way they could bring down their father.
<p>it didn’t stop her from hating her sister and any time she sees nyssa she’s on edge. but there are times when they have an uneasy alliance to get done what needs to be done.</div>
<p><div id="hc">&#9642; <b>jason todd:</b> jason todd was supposed to have been talia’s way of getting back into bruce’s good graces. she knew just how much he grieved at the loss of his robin and how he blamed himself. the lazarus pit was the only thing that could bring the dead back to life and it was her that stole his body from its grave. what was meant to have been something good turned into a nightmare and she thought it the worst mistake of her life. she had wanted to return jason to bruce as the robin he once was. instead, he was nothing than a shell of himself, reacting only to herself.
<p>it was then when she decided to take a different approach, treating him like her son in the hopes she could get through to him and send him back to gotham. she remembered that there were certain things bruce wouldn’t do and she decided that she would mould jason into the sort of hero that the city needed. talia set it all up and sent him away for the training she knew he would eventually need, always keeping tabs on him just in case something happened. each report had her smiling and she set it up so that he would be provided for while he set up his home in gotham.
<p>the one night stand was nothing more than that to her. she could never love jason. not like she loved bruce and she wasn’t going to tie him down. instead, she left him the one thing she knew he would use; his mask. talia knew that after that night they’d never be the same. she’d made a point of reminded him that she couldn’t love him and that his focus needed to be on gotham. in her heart she did care for him but it was never love.</div>
<p><div id="hc">&#9642; <b>damian wayne:</b> damian wayne is the only other person besides bruce that she truly loves. she knows that she isn’t the motherly type, she knows she wasn’t a great mother to damian but she tried the best she could. while she was pregnant with him, talia had a hard time connecting with him in the womb. for a long while it actually felt surreal, like it wasn’t real. a part of that had to do with the fact that she’d lied to the man she loved and a part of it had to do with the fact that she never saw herself as a mother. but the moment she held damian in her arms she fell in love with her son. from that day forward she promised she would do whatever she had to do to keep him safe.
<p>as damian grew up talia made certain he had the best tutors she could find, similar to what ra’s had done with her. she also made certain that he was able to fight, that he could use knives, swords, and any other weapon that she’d been taught to use herself. being small in statue she also wanted him to be able to use that to his advantage. only when ra’s started to look at damian as his heir did she start to rethink him being under his tutelage. the last thing she wanted for her son was to take over the league. not when she had plans of her own. having her own son as the leader of the league meant one day she’d have to kill him to take what was rightfully hers.
<p>she knew there was only one person she trusted enough to take care of her son; bruce. as much as she hated to do it, she knew that her former husband was the only person that could protect damian. once again she packed up her belongings, she packed up damian’s belongings and dropped him off on bruce’s doorstep with a note asking him to take care of their son and to one day forgive her for keeping him from him. talia also reminded damian that he was more than a bat and that she loved him before leaving him behind. she always kept an eye on him, she made certain he was safe and while she hated that bruce had turned their son into a robin she wouldn’t ever interfere with that.</div>
<p><div id="hc">&#9642; <b>bruce wayne // batman:</b>bruce wayne is more than just her husband; he is the love of her life. other than damian, he is the only person she truly loves. talia fell in love with bruce after the other rescued her from doctor darrk. initially, she consented to being used as a pawn by ra’s to test whether or not bruce would be a suitable heir. she had heard of batman growing up and knew of his attempts to thwart ra’s attempts at using the lazarus pits, and it was why she initially consented. but after her rescue, seeing the way he handled himself in person and having to kill darrk to save him, she found herself falling in love with him. while their marriage was meant to be a way of keeping bruce as an ally and as an heir, and as a token of goodwill courtesy of ra’s, she saw him as someone who would actually love her. from that love came their son damian, and talia had every intention of making a life with bruce and their unborn son. but when the terrorists attacked them in the arctic, she was reminded that their life would never be normal, that they would constantly be a target, and she did what she thought was best; she used the stress of the attack to convince bruce she’d had a miscarriage.
<p>it pained her to tell him that and to watch him leave her behind. but in her mind it was what she felt was best. once things calmed down she put distance between herself and ra’s, and once damian was born she returned to the relative safety of ra’s and their compound. it wasn’t her first choice and if she’d thought bruce would open her with welcome arms after her lie, she would’ve gone to him. but she knew he wouldn’t forgive her for that. for ten years her heart yearned for bruce, and it was a combination of that and the fact she didn’t want their son to follow in ra’s footsteps that forced her to leave their son with the only other family he had. talia always had someone watching out for not only bruce but damian; not out of control but because in her heart she still loved him.
<p>one day she hopes to reconcile with bruce; if not for themselves than for their son. she has no misgivings in thinking that bruce still loves her like she loves him. talia is more than willing to accept an uneasy friendship between them. though given the fact that she still wants to fulfil her father’s goals and bruce will always want to stop her from doing that she knows that even a friendship would be difficult.</div>

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>early life</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Sophie Moore was born to Diane Moore and an unknown father and implied to have been raised in a conservative family. Upon discovering she was attracted to women, Sophie feared coming out to anyone, especially her mother, as Diane held prejudiced views towards LGBT individuals.
<p>In adulthood, Sophie studied at Point Rock Academy, where she developed a secret romantic relationship with her classmate, Kate Kane. The two often snuck off to make out despite the policy of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell", which was still in effect at the time. A week before graduation, they were caught by a superior and forced to reveal what had been happening. Given the option to deny the homosexual allegations, Sophie and Kate decided to tell the truth, feeling optimistic that the school wouldn't kick out their best cadets. Before that, Sophie asked the school not to call her mother, fearing Diane's reaction if she found out. Sophie was then visited by Kate's father, Jacob Kane who pointed out that Point Rock would just expel both her and Kate no matter what, despite the two being their best students. After this talk, Sophie decided to take the offer, wishing to graduate. As a result, she and Kate broke up.
<p>After graduation, Sophie went on to work for Crows Security, soon rising to become a high-ranking agent and earning the personal respect of Commander Jacob Kane. In 2015, she married fellow Crows agent Tyler. However, Sophie kept Tyler and her social circle in the dark about her orientation.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>rise of batwoman</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>In 2018, Sophie helped lead the team during an event in which the Bat-Signal was being turned off. During the event, Sophie sees someone in a white rabbit mask and proceeds to chase after them. She manages to grab onto the person wearing the white rabbit mask, but the two end up fighting one another. She then gets grabbed from behind after incapacitating the person in the white rabbit mask. She falls off the railing in the second fight, but her fall is cushioned. However, a Gang wearing animal masks takes her captive. She gets knocked out and is put inside a van. Later it's revealed that Sophie was kidnapped by Alice's gang, who wished to make a statement to Commander Kane.
<p>The following night, Sophie was taken as a hostage and made to stand on a plank of wood hanging from a skyscraper above the city's movie in the park event, Dodgson, one of Sophie's co-workers is seen walking to where Alice is keeping her, Sophie asks for help, but he's revealed to be working with Alice, as she tells her to have fun and walks away with Sophie calling him a traitor. The barrel holding the plank up was eventually slashed open, causing Sophie to plummet down, however, she was saved by a masked vigilante, who covered her as they crashed down into an abandoned building; and seeing the individual from up-close, Sophie could tell that her rescuer was a woman causing her to breath out that the latter was not “him”. Returning to work, Sophie caught a glimpse of Kate. She went to find her, thanking her for returning to help. They were joined by Tyler, whom Sophie introduced to Kate, who was emotionally hurt that her “old fling” settled down without her even realizing it up to that point.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>falling in love with batwoman</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>After divorcing Tyler and the Anti-Monitor crisis, Sophie begins a relationship with Batwoman, not knowing that underneath the mask is her ex, Kate Kane. Soon after, Sophie's boss, Jacob Kane, discovers that she helps Batwoman and suspends her. Later, she informs Batwoman of her situation, she says that she understands her, but at the moment where Batwoman leaves, Sophie says of waiting and they kiss.
<p>The next night, Batwoman goes to Sophie's home and they have an official first date. Batwoman wants to protect her and says that they don't see again because she has enemies and that they do the link she will be in danger, but Sophie answers her that she can defend herself, then they kiss. But Sophie's mother arrives, forcing Batwoman to leave.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>investigating lucius fox's murder</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Sophie met with Jacob who informed him that he was beginning to believe that someone in the Crows covered up footage from Sip&Dash on the night Lucius Fox was murdered. Sophie told him she had not changed her opinion on Batwoman, but she agreed to help him. Sophie went to the home of Alia Nazari, the owner of Sip &amp; Dash, to question her only to find her dead. Sophie was then saved by Julia Pennyworth from unseen snipers. Julia introduced herself to being another of Kate's ex-girlfriends, much to Sophie's surprise while taking her to Mary's clinic to treat a bullet wound that Julia received while protecting Sophie.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>returning to the crows</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Later, Sophie returns to the Crows on Jacob Kane's demand, and leads a new Crows strike team, together with Julia Pennyworth. She seems attracted to her. Later, after Julia has escaped from Hush, Sophie is reassured and kisses her. Julia kisses her too, and at this moment is when Kate arrives to speak to her.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>personality</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Sophie has a strong sense of justice. When Sophie discovered her sexuality, she feared coming out to others because she grew up with a parent who despised LGBT individuals. During her time at Point Rock Academy, Sophie loved Kate and eventually decided to reveal her sexuality to her fellow cadets, but after a chat with Jacob Kane, Sophie changed her mind and stayed at Point Rock though she regretted ending her relationship with Kate.
<p>Sophie struggled to be two different types; one where her family would be proud of and the other who was true to herself. However, after ending her marriage to Tyler and being in love with Batwoman, Sophie realized she could not be two separate individuals and decided to come out to her mother, even though this led to their estrangement.
<p>Sophie is proven to be very sympathetic as she comforted Mary who was grieving over her mother's death. Sophie is also proven to be a friendly individual as she quickly became friends with Julia Pennyworth, another ex-girlfriend of Kate's, without displaying any resentment towards her. On the contrary, she has started to develop romantic feelings for her.

<center><h3>trivia</h3></center>
<p>&#9642; Sophie weighs 125 lbs
<p>&#9642; She has two degrees.
<p>&#9642; Sophie is possibly bisexual due to her marriage to Tyler and past relationship with Kate Kane. While her sexuality has yet to be confirmed, she will be written as bisexual with her interests being primarily with women
<br />


<center><h3>headcanons</h3></center>
<div id="hc"><p>&#9642; <b>sexuality:</b> for as long as sophie can remember she always struggled with her sexuality. growing up in a conservative family meant she struggled even more so than most. her background, particularly in relation to not only her family but specifically her upbringing as a whole, was steeped in compulsory heteronormativity from a very young age. this manifested in not only the belief that deviance from the norm of a nuclear family and the societally encouraged norms of marriage and domesticity were things to be avoided at all cost, but that any behaviours she might engage in that could be seen in this light was something that could lead to not only exile from her social & familial groups, but also the very real threat of bodily harm. except that sort of life didn’t make sense to her. in school she found herself looking at men and women, <b>and</b> then she would constantly hear her mother’s voice. eventually, sophie felt like she was broken, like there was something wrong with her because she wasn’t like the image her mother painted for her. it was something she constantly struggled with. even when she was accepted into point rock academy.
<p>their policy of don’t ask don’t tell made it easier for her to ignore the confusion that constantly bubbled to the surface. if anything could help sort her out she was certain the military could. until she met kate kane. at first they were roommates and would constant push each other to do better. but the more they studied together the closer they became. their first kiss clicked something in sophie that she never thought possible. and it showed her that she wasn’t broken. her interests just laid heavily with women instead of men. it also meant that the don’t ask don’t tell policy at point rock was going to make her life more difficult than anything else. she never complained and worked hard to be at the top of her class as she knew it was the only way she could have the sort of life she wanted.
<p>until they got caught. as much as she wanted to believe kate she knew she couldn’t throw the papers aside. she needed point rock and that meant locking everything up into a place where no one would ever find it again. sophie actually begged them not to call her mother because she knew exactly how that conversation would go. instead, she received comfort and guidance from kate’s father because he knew about his daughter’s sexuality. jacob helped her to see the unfortunate reality; that while kate might be free to exercise her privilege and go in, burning down the room around her, she didn’t have that choice. burning the room down around her, too, would end up ruining her life in ways she could never recover from. point rock also showed her that she needed to ignore her desires for women and focus on men instead. it’s why in the end she married tyler and why she told kate once again that they needed to keep their distance. sophie knows that kate is her one weakness and that if they spend time together it will reopen that part of her life that she’d buried after being caught at point rock.
<p><i>*the relationship with her family and the compulsory heteronormativity is one of the reasons why sophie developed perfectionist tendencies. in her mind it was the only way she could show she was just as good as the others in her class and the others she would be competing with as a crow. unfortunately, when she and tyler went their separate ways it was seen as rejecting that part of herself and led to estrangement with her mother. it also led to being told that her mother was disappointed in her because she rejected the life that had been created for her; something she’d been trying to avoid all of her life.</i>

<b>there isn’t one good thing in any of this</b> &mdash; <a href="/tagged/⸢ verse → sophie ⸥ ❛ v; there isn’t one good thing in any of this ❜ || the old guard">threads</a> Her life had been planned out ever since she realised just what she wanted to do. Point Rock, the military and eventually the Crows. It was what she wanted and she’d risked everything to make that happen; even breaking her heart in the process. Sophie had known telling Kate to leave would hurt, but hearing about her death hurt even more so. The guilt kept piling on and while she was content in her relationship, it wouldn’t ever be enough. She worked her way up to second in command and her life was content. Until a ghost from the past. That was the catalyst for her eventual death, something she couldn’t prepare for. She’d been shot before, but this — this was different and had it not been for Kate she might’ve thought she was losing her mind. Waking up in her apartment had been strange. But not as strange as seeing the group of strangers surrounding her. In time she came to accept being immortal and while it meant leaving her life as a Crow behind at least she would have the familiarity of Kate by her side.<br /><br />

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>early life</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Kate Kane was born on January 26, 1990 to Jacob and Gabi Kane, along with her twin sister, Beth, in Gotham City. From an early age, Kate was very close to her cousin, Bruce Wayne, who was like an older brother to her. Kate and Beth were inseparable growing up, doing everything together; the twins would often visit Bruce at Wayne Enterprises and once when they were little, Kate convinced Beth to sneak into his office. While playing in the room, Kate noticed a pearl necklace in a square pyramid-shaped glass container and tried to touch it. However, Beth stopped her and suggested they leave the office immediately.
<p>Kate and Beth often snuck into the abandoned Burnside Orphanage to play ouija, taking turns scaring each other. On Fridays after school, they would go to a waffle stand at Burnside Park to eat chocolate-covered waffles.
<p>On January 26, 2003, Kate and Beth had a Bat Mitzvah to celebrate their 13th birthday. After the party winded down and the family prepared to leave, Kate took a box of mints as a keepsake. Jacob drove home with his car full of Kate and Beth's birthday presents, so the twins planned to go with their mother. Before they left, Gabi gifted Kate and Beth garnet necklaces, their birthstones, which matched her ruby earrings, to ensure the three of them would keep each other close to their hearts as they grew up.
<p>While driving home with Gabi, Kate enthusiastically suggested she and Beth take a polaroid picture together to commemorate the day. Suddenly, the family's car was rammed by the Joker, who had hijacked a school bus, and they veered off the road, almost going over a bridge. However, Kate noticed Batman arrive and assured Beth they would be safe. Batman used two grappling hooks to attach the car to the bridge before leaving to deal with the Joker. As Beth tried to wake their mother, Kate quickly climbed out of the car through the broken rear window, shouting for Batman and why he was leaving so suddenly. As the bridge's pillar began to give away, Kate tried to reach for Beth's hand to pull her sister out, but the car broke away from the bridge, plunging into the cliff's river below. A horrified Kate was left on the bridge as the sole survivor, screaming for her mother and sister.
<p>This tragedy left Kate devastated and traumatized. She also started believing Batman only cared about catching the villain rather than saving innocent people, since he didn't stop to help Gabi and Beth. As Jacob began drifting away from her in his own grief, Bruce comforted Kate through her healing process. The whole city spent months helping Kate and Jacob search for Gabi and Beth until Gabi's body was recovered. Feeling that Beth was still alive, Kate became determined to find her sister.
<p>On May 25, 2004, Jacob married Catherine and Kate met her step-sister, Mary Hamilton. However, she was somewhat distant from Mary growing up, since they were fairly different from one another. Nonetheless, Kate was very close with Catherine, accepting her as a mother-figure. Also, despite her usual tough facade, Kate eventually grew fond of and and came to love Mary overtime, often guiding and watching out for her step-sister.
<p>At some point, Kate openly came out as a lesbian.
<p>In her teenage years, Kate attended Gotham Preparatory High School, during which she played club soccer. At one point, Kate was grounded by her father for an entire summer after Jacob found a reefer inside her school bag. In 2011 after Mary turned 16, Kate taught her step-sister how to drive despite not having a driver's license herself, once charming the cops into not giving them a ticket after their car was pulled over. When Derrick Peters ditched Mary at homecoming, Kate hunted him down and locked Derrick in a urinal to get back at him for hurting her step-sister.

<center><h3>time at point rock academy</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Wanting to join her father Jacob's Crows Security, Kate studied at Point Rock Academy, where she met Sophie Moore. The two women rose to become the academy's top cadets. Despite the military's strict code of conduct against homosexuality at the time, the two fell in love with each other and would secretly sneak off somewhere secret to make out.
<p>A week before graduation, Kate and Sophie snuck to the back of a shed, where they made out and engraved their names into the wood. However, a superior caught them. The academy offered them a chance deny the homosexual allegations against them in order to remain at Point Rock, but Kate wanted to reveal the truth, confident that the academy would not kick out their top cadets. As such, she defied their orders and quit the academy. However, Sophie suddenly got a second opinion (after a talk with Jacob) and decided she wanted to graduate, accepting Point Rock's offer. Due to their different ideals, the two broke up.
<p>In 2013, following Kate's expulsion, Jacob suggested that she leave Gotham to travel around the world, training under combat and survival specialists. Presumably, Kate received news of Bruce and Batman's disappearance from Gotham around 2015.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>returning to gotham</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>By 2018, Kate was training under an old man in a barren icy region, she suddenly received a call from Mary, who informed her of Sophie's kidnapping by Alice's gang, Kate immediately left for Gotham City earlier than she would've wanted to, heading straight for Crows Security, where she visited her father. She asked for Sophie's whereabouts and offered her assistance to the Crows, but her father disagreed and left to answer a call.
<p>Wanting answers, Kate drove to Wayne Enterprises to use the Wayne Security system, she scaled the building, arriving in Bruce's office and reminiscing over her time sneaking inside with Beth when they were little, suddenly, the head of Wayne Security, Luke Fox, held Kate at gunpoint, knowing she was going to be cuffed, she secretly grabbed a paper clip and went with him, she tried introducing herself as Bruce's cousin, but Luke refused to believe her, he took Kate to the surveillance room and called the police, when she broke free and cuffed Luke to a system unit, taking his keys. Kate logged into the system, copying surveillance of the gang and leaving Luke's keys for him just out of his reach.
<p>Arriving at the Kane penthouse, Kate was surprised with a welcome-home party, she was bombarded by Mary's rambling, when Kate interrupted to ask why Mary called her from her training, Mary revealed that she had accidentally discovered a box of pictures of her and Sophie and thought that Kate would want to come home, they were interrupted by Kate's step-mother Catherine, who asked for Mary to do a picture with the councilwoman, behind her, she saw a picture of her father and Sophie's acceptance into the Crows and recalled their tumultuous history. Showing her father the surveillance footage, they tracked the gang down to Burnside Orphanage, where the Crows converged upon.
<p>Kate went ahead first, fighting through a number of thugs, but ultimately being knocked out, coming to, Kate came face to face with the gang's leader, Alice, Alice taunted her for some time, before knocking her back out and having her taken to a makeshift clinic run by Mary, waking to find Mary stitching a wound on her arm, Kate headed back to Crows Security to inform her father of her findings. Instead of taking her intel, he became angry at her having run off, causing Kate to give up and do her own thing.

<center><h3>personality (kate kane)</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Even as a child, Kate was proving to be short-sighted, as she believed that her cousin, Bruce Wayne (under the persona of Batman) didn't care about saving her mother, Gabi Goldstein, and her twin sister, Beth Kane, from the car that was hanging from a bridge after he had secured it with one of his grappling hooks, completely disregarding the fact that the Dark Knight had to go and save the school children from the Joker, as he cannot be in 2 places simultaneously, something she didn't realise until after she had discovered that Bruce is Batman.
<p>Even during Kate's youth, it is implied that she was already aware of her queerness and was fine with it; she was often seen garbed in rather boyish attires, like the suit and tie she wore just before the crash, that separated her from her twin and killed their mother, took place and will carry this on as a habit of wearing masculine clothing for the rest of her maturing years to follow.
<p>As an adult, Kate is fearless, passionate and reckless, her fearless and passionate traits also makes her blind to reality; for example, a week before Kate could graduates from Point Rock Academy, she and then-girlfriend, Sophie Moore got caught violating the academy's strict code of conduct against homosexuality, she was given a choice, deny the homosexual allegations against her or get expelled, Kate believed that because she was the academy's top cadet (along with Sophie) she would not get expelled by the tribunal, as she refused to deny the allegations against her; regarding her sexuality. Unfortunately, Kate finds out the hard way that she was wrong; as she was ultimately expelled from Point Rock Academy.
<p>Kate is similar to her cousin, Bruce; as she is a no-nonsense and blunt individual. She is very open with her personal opinion and proud of her sexuality.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>personality (batwoman)</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>As Batwoman, Kate is very stoic and committed to helping Gotham City. While mostly an antisocial individual, she can give respect to those she thinks deserves it, as she acknowledged Supergirl's worth as a hero.
<p>Kate is proven to have good morals; for example, when her twin sister, Beth Kane informed Kate that her step-mother and mother-figure, Catherine Hamilton had paid the coroner to fake the DNA test over some skull fragments of a deer found by some of her men to make it match Beth's, causing the entire city to stop searching for her sister, Kate was completely enraged and disgusted to the point that she avoided having any direct interaction with her, as she cannot be associated with an immoral individual, who was indirectly responsible for Beth becoming the sociopath she is today, souring her relationship with Mary in the process.
<p>Although Kate hated Catherine for playing god with her family's lives, this did not mean that she wanted her dead, when Beth had killed her soon to be ex-step-mother and framed their father, Jacob Kane for it, she was furious at what her twin sister had done, as she was filled with grief over her step-mother's murder, more likely she's downhearted to know that her sister could do something so horrible to there father, however, despite this, she has not truly forgiven Catherine for her immoral actions and obviously never will. Most likely she despises her even more, after learning the full extent of the trauma Beth had to endure for more than a decade due to a part to Catherine's manipulations.
<p>However, Kate later crossed the moral line when she killed August Cartwright, the very individual directly responsible for Beth becoming the murdering sociopath she is today, after he revealed that he had desecrated her mother, Gabi Goldstein's corpse keeping her severed head, proving that she is not as moral as her cousin, Bruce Wayne; the latter who will never intentionally take his enemies' lives, regardless of the circumstance. At least that is what she believed until she learned from Luke Fox that Bruce killed his greatest enemy, the Joker.
<p>After Kate killed August, it is very likely that she can no longer be angry with her twin sister, Beth, regarding Catherine's murder, since Kate crossed a moral line herself and also realizing that deep down, despite everything she had done, she still clearly cared for Beth and never stopped loving her sister. But this did not stop her from regretfully betraying her sister and leaving her in Arkham so she can get help, but also because Kate wanted to preserve whatever morality she has left inside of her. However, this act of betrayal led to the deaths and torture of many of Gotham's citizens, including Arkham's late warden Dr. Butler.
<p>Kate's hubris is her greatest flaw as ever since she began to forgive herself for failing her sister many years ago, she began constantly taunting her, betraying her and being more than willing to let her die. This act of false self-pride led Gotham to be under more chaos than ever before. Her own father blames her (as Batwoman) more than Alice for the latter's new and more horrific reign of terror, as he believes Alice needs her as much as she needs Alice, comparing their antagonism to be very much like Batman and the Joker's antagonism.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>abilities</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>&#9642; As a vigilante, former soccer athlete and former member of the Point Rock Academy (being one of the academy's top cadets alongside Sophie Moore) Kate is in the best physical condition, strong enough to throw her enemies into the air and quickly master opponents much larger than her with relative ease. In fact, her physical strength seems to be even a bit inhuman, as she has shown little to no difficulty in lifting and throwing around full-grown men. She was strong enough to punch through the ice from underwater, kick open the boarded-up doors to Bruce Wayne's office, break a metal staff over her knee, and kick down Reagan's double-locked door. She is fast enough to exit a room unnoticed, not dissimilar to her cousin. Kate also has a high level of stamina, as by her own admission, she can hold her breath for two minutes, but it gets "shaky" after two minutes pass. Her reflexes allowed her to catch Alice's knife before it could hit her doppelgänger, as well as dodge her own grappling gun's hook. Her father gave her permission to join the Crows which she turned down, putting her on par with former Navy SEALs and Green Berets.
<p>&#9642; Since becoming Batwoman, Kate has developed free-running skills and can fall from a height of several feet without hurting herself. Her abilities allow her to dodge and attack with fluidity from different directions without losing balance, as seen during her duel with the Executioner. She has also shown to be capable of reaching the tops of skyscrapers throughout Gotham. When Kate returned home, she was able to easily climb up to a window of the Wayne Enterprises building. She demonstrated the ability to perform multiple variations of flips during her training in the Batcave.
<p>&#9642; Kate's senses and reaction time are super. She was able to avoid a sword strike from one of Alice's henchmen without looking.
<p>&#9642; Kate is very intelligent; despite her part-time heroism, she manages Wayne Enterprises without any perceivable difficulty. Alice called her "clever".
<p>&#9642; Kate is a very perceptive individual; as she was able to quickly determine that Supergirl is Kara Danvers. She thought to access Wayne Enterprises' security camera feed, which was not included in the Crows Security network. She is also observant of small details; she recognized the miniscule writing on a paddle held by one of Alice's henchmen, which allowed her to locate her whereabouts. She also noticed a pattern in the Executioner's methods of killing.
<p>&#9642; Kate is very good at keeping her own identity as Batwoman a secret; the highly intelligent Oliver Queen, Barry Allen and Kara Danvers were unable to deduce her alter-ego; Kara had to resort to using her x-ray vision to discover who Batwoman is.
<p>&#9642; Kate rides a motorcycle.
<p>&#9642; Kate is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist. She was able to quickly subdue Oliver Queen, a master hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist in his own right, and Barry Allen simultaneously when reality itself was altered and they had each other's powers and combat skills, although it should be noted that she took them by surprise. Kate's fighting style so far consists of Boxing, Tai Chi, Kung Fu, Kickboxing, Karate, Taekwondo, Krav Maga, Sambo, Judo, Hapkido, Muay Thai, and Aikido. Cisco Ramon referred to Kate as "badass" only moments after witnessing her in action and Kara Danvers even stated that the two of them would make a good team, not dissimilar to their cousins' relationship. Before becoming Batwoman, Kate easily overpower several of Beth Kane's henchmen and even made use of her environment to fight them off, i.e. weaponizing a fire extinguisher, frying pan and a door. However, Luke Fox stated that Kate's combat skills are ultimately inferior to Bruce Wayne's.
<p>&#9642; Kate is proven to have great accuracy when she threw her batarang at an escaped inmate at Arkham Asylum and caught it when it returned to her after subduing the inmate. She also accurately threw one to knock Beth Kane's remote off a building.
<p>&#9642; Kate is proven to be a highly skilled stick-fighter; as she was able to take down Beth Kane and the Wonderland gang with a bo-staff. As well as handling multiple adversaries with two batons.
<p>&#9642; Kate is highly skilled in the use of firearms; she dominated the sharpshooting competition and earned a medal for her skills at Point Rock Academy for hitting her target dead-on every single time, even while she was hungover. She was the only one out of 200 members to do this. She later precisely shot a Crows Security van's tire from 50 meters to rescue Julia Pennyworth.
<p>&#9642; As Batwoman, Kate has an intimidating appearance, capable of instilling fear in her enemies, this was seen when a criminal, from Arkham Asylum, cried out of fear when he saw Batwoman. However, despite this, she is not as terrifying as Bruce Wayne (under the persona of Batman) even a psychopath like Beth Kane didn't display any visible signs of fear towards Kate; prior to her discovering that the latter is Batwoman.
<p>&#9642; Kate is extremely secretive, being able to approach other people without being sensed. She was able to escape from a pair of handcuffs using a paperclip as well as using a nail to escape from a pair of handcuffs. Kate also quickly evaded her father's line of sight before she went to find Beth. Kate was able to snatch a Kryptonite compact from Earth-99 Bruce Wayne without anyone noticing.
<p>&#9642; A driven and determined individual, Kate is nearly fearless and almost never gives up under most situations; for example, she correctly never believed that her twin sister, Beth Kane was dead, even when her father, Jacob Kane, told her that investigators found skull fragments on a nearby farm and had them tested to reveal that they belonged to Beth and that the farm had already been checked on multiple occasions; due to the fact that Beth's body was never found. Kate also has a high tolerance for pain as she didn't display any signs of discomfort when she received stitches on her shoulder.

<b>the world can burn for all i care</b> &mdash; <a href="/tagged/⸢ verse → kate ⸥ ❛ v; the world can burn for all i care ❜ || the old guard">threads</a>: War had broken out across the continent and all Katherine can think about is helping. She couldn’t be a soldier. Women weren’t allowed to fight. Given her short hair and dressing more in pants than dresses, she was certain that she could easily slip into one of the regiments. But she wasn’t the sort who wanted to kill another human being. Instead, she found another line of work. The French always needed help and with her looks no one would even question her. For months on end she would slip into enemy camps, into their society and then she would slip out, bringing intel with her. The allies never question where it came from only that it was intel that worked for her. Unfortunately, her luck ran out and crossing paths with the germans she found a bullet to the head her fate for espionage. They left her for dead in the forest and it was Andromache that eventually found her, explaining that she had a purpose and that she would join others like her. Kate never cared. She didn’t want to be a part of it. But working with the others she found her purpose and she’s come to enjoy working with them. Even to the point of killing those that deserved it.<br /><br />

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>the file</h3></center>
<p>Jacob "Jake" Kane is a former USSOCOM colonel of the United States Army and the former head of Crows Security. He is also the brother of the late Martha Wayne, the estranged father of Kate Kane and Beth Kane, the widower of the late Gabi Kane and the late Catherine Hamilton-Kane, the estranged maternal uncle of Bruce Wayne and the step-father of Mary Hamilton.
<p>Jacob had Crows Security thoroughly investigated and those found being corrupt where fired or arrested. it took time but eventually jacob returned crows security to its former reputation and implemented a strict hiring process.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>personality</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Jacob was once a loving husband and father to his wife, Gabi, and his two daughters, Kate Kane and Beth Kane, however, after the car crash that killed his wife and supposedly one of his daughters, he became overprotective over Kate, his surviving daughter, deeming her as "everything he has left". Due to Jacob being overcome with grief over the loss, his relationship with Kate became strained, despite trying to give her a good future and accepting the woman she has grown to be, not particularly concerned that she is a non-straight individual. Jacob is proven to be deeply concerned about the welfare of others as when Alice had his second-in-command, Sophie Moore was held hostage, he pleaded her not to bomb all those civilians who were watching a movie at Robinson Park. The only reason Jacob formed Crows Security was to recruit ex-Navy SEALS and Green Berets to protect Gotham City and assist the GCPD in situations they cannot handle.
<p>Jacob firmly believes that justice can only come from law and order and disapproves vigilantes, such as Batman and Batwoman, describing them as a "symbol of false hope" and also blaming the former for the death of his wife and daughter due to failing to save them for the car crash. He also felt that vigilantes are liked by the city because they didn't subscribe to the rules, in his eyes, Batman is also responsible for creating the Joker and several other villains in Gotham's rogues gallery; completely disregarding the fact that Gotham was already a crime infested state to begin with, long before Bruce ever became Batman, as these said criminals would have emerged on their own, even if Bruce didn't become a vigilante in the first place. He was willing to go war with Batwomen instead of working together to capture escaped criminals and arrest anyone associated with her proving how far his hatred of vigilantes has costumed him. He also has no problem with breaking a truce as seen when he had the Crows kill Tim Teslow instead of letting Batwoman talk him down and attempt to kill her afterwards. This unknowingly strained her relationship with Kate, who Jacob never realized was actually the very vigilante he was trying to kill until she went missing and Alice told him the truth. This revelation caused Jacob to be overcome with guilt and remorse as he realized he tried to kill his own daughter and how it damaged his relationship with her.
<p>Jacob is proven to be extremely arrogant and self-righteous to the point that he doesn't take responsibility for his mistakes, blaming others for what happened to Beth only to later admitting it was a coping mechanism for not blaming himself and facing the truth that he was the one responsible for it; due to having stopped searching for her and believed that she was dead. Yet, he is not above apologizing or admitting when he was wrong. Also, even when having different view over something with one of his subordinate, like when he and Sophie disagreed about trusting Batwoman, he has demonstrated that he can be impartial on it, since what really matter to Jacob is to be able to trust his agents.
<p>Jacob knows that he can't talk his daughter, Kate out of anything once her mind is made up, as after she and Sophie were caught violating Point Rock Academy's strict code of conduct against homosexuality, he did not try to convince her to do what the academy's tribunal wanted nor explained to her that being one of it's top cadets doesn't get her special treatment or makes her above the rules, as he knew it would have been pointless.
<p>Jacob is proven to have loved Beth deeply; when he learned that his second wife, Catherine Hamilton, had paid the coroner to fake the DNA test over some skull fragments of a deer found by some of her men to make it match Beth's, he was angry, telling his second wife to get away from him and filing for divorce and in 2003 willingly trespassed August Cartwright's house after getting a call from Beth and tracing it there. While he was held captive by Beth he also broke down and confessed that believing Catherine was easier to him than going to bed with a broken heart, tearfully apologizing to his daughter for failing her. However, after Beth poisoned Catherine and framed him for her murder, he lost all hope that his daughter could be saved from the monster she had become and even ordered Sophie to have the Crows to kill her on sight. Also, he started to see Alice and Beth as two different individuals, declaring that whatever August did to his daughter erased any traces of her and Alice was mentally put in her place.
<p>Despite this, after learning that August has Alice tortured in an unknown location, Jacob immediately went to save her, threatening to skin August alive after doing so, after saving her, Jacob makes it clear to Alice that he still cares for her despite everything she has done, becoming even more sympathetic towards her after learning more of what she endured at the hands of Mabel Cartwright and what August did to her mother's remains but, despite this, he chose to lock her in Arkham anyway with Kate's help so she wouldn't hurt anyone else, though he was visibly solemn and saddened over having to do so, when he later visited her he explained that he had to lock her up so he can protect the only daughters he had left; Kate and Mary. In response, Alice vowed to make him suffer far worse than how she's suffering behind Arkham's walls, hearing this, Jacob was heartbroken on how far his daughter has slipped.
<p>Jacob is proven to have some morals; for example, after he discovered that Catherine had paid the coroner to fake the DNA test over some skull fragments of a deer found by some of her men to make it match Beth's, causing the entire city to stop searching for his second daughter, Jacob became enraged and disgusted to the point that he filed for divorce, yet that didn't mean he wanted her dead; when Beth killed Catherine and framing him for it, he was furious at what his daughter has done and filled with grief over his second wife's murder as well as the thought that his daughter could do something so horrible. However, despite this, he has not truly forgiven Catherine for her despicable actions and likely never will, and while he doesn't condone murder, he has obviously forgiven Alice for her actions after realizing the full extent of the abuse she suffered the hands of August Cartwright which was caused by Catherine, and he obviously stopped grieving; for her when he found out about the full extent of August's abuse. Despite being on the verge of divorce Catherine, that never intruded on his desire to still be Mary Hamilton's father-figure, since he love her and care very much for her well being. Additionally, despite having hated and wanted Batwoman dead, once he learned Kate was actually Batwoman, he immediately deeply regretted his treatment of Kate and continued to try to find her and hunt down whoever was responsible for his daughter's supposed death.
<p>Jacob has a homicidal side; as he tried to murder Kate (under the persona of Batwoman) in cold blood for no clear reason instead of just arresting her without; as he had no guilt, shame or remorse for this despicable act of his, he even planned to search for a bullet that could kill her as Jacob has no problem lying to his own step-daughter, Mary; since he lied to Mary when he made the alliance with Batwoman.
<p>But Jacob's attempt to murder the female bat vigilant in cold blood had unforeseen consequences; after a video of Jacob and his crows agents attempting to kill Batwoman in cold blood was leaked to the public; Crows Security gained a negative reputation, and the citizens of Gotham City have lost any trust and respect that they once had for the crows.
<p>Jacob had created the crows to protect Gotham City and he (delusively) believes that the crows are more effective than Batman; completely disregarding the fact that the Dark Knight protected all citizens of Gotham, regardless of whether or not they are upper-class, middle-class or low-class citizens without asking for anything; while the crows only protected upper-class citizens and get paid for it.
<p>Due to knowing the fact that Kate was Batwoman, Jacob is beginning to become more tolerant towards the new Batwoman, especially after the new Batwoman saved him from the False Face Society. Jacob went far as to acknowledge to Sophie and the Crows that he would be dead if not for Kate's successor.
<p>After Luke Fox was almost killed in cold blood by Russell Tavaroff, a corrupt agent of Crows Security, and after Jacob was almost killed by Russell and his posse, he realized the full extent of the organization's corruption; Jacob ultimately disbanded Crows Security; in order to prevent any more innocent civilians' lives from being destroyed by the crows. Jacob also realises that he is indirectly responsible for Crows Security becoming so corrupt; as for years he had been harbouring such despicable actions; but he overlook them; due the crows getting the job done, but they cross several moral lines in the process.
<p>While Jacob does care about members of his own family, he has a strained relationship with his nephew, Bruce Wayne, as seen when Tommy briefly impersonated him. It was implied that Bruce resented Jacob over wrongfully holding his alter-ego, Batman responsible for what happened to Gabi and Beth, as well as for having an unjustified hatred towards vigilantes in general. As a result; Bruce could never trust his uncle, Jacob with his secret identity as Batman.

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>early life</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>There were many rumors and speculation as to what happened to Han Solo in his earlier years. He was the subject of several holofilms, documentaries and at least two supposed "autobiographies" whose true authorship was questionable. For example, one contested account said that Solo was raised by Wookiees from age seven to twelve after his parents left him.
<p>In reality, Han Solo was orphaned at an early age, and his earliest memories were of being found in a Corellian spaceport by Garris Shrike with no clear memory of his life beforehand. Shrike took Solo in as a member of his band of vagabonds, training and using him in his underhanded enterprises. First, Han was sent out as a beggar, using his young appearance to get handouts. When he was older, Han learned how to pickpocket by first practicing on a droid of Shrike's, and then being sent out into the streets. During this time, Solo was befriended by Dewlanna, a Wookiee who was serving as a cook aboard Trader's Luck, Shrike's ship. Dewlanna raised Solo as her own son, teaching him Shyriiwook and taking care of him when he became ill. Han would go on to participate in numerous scams and illegal activities under Shrike's direction, including participating in an asteroid mining scam and swoop racing.
<p>Though Solo wanted to learn more about his family, especially his parents, Shrike kept all that information from him in order to better keep him under his control. For years, he did not even know his family name. At one point, soon after learning from Dewlanna that he was part of the famous Solo line, he ran away from Shrike on Corellia. There, he tracked down his long lost aunt Tiion Solo and his cousin, Thrackan Sal-Solo. The reunion with his family went badly, however—his aunt was a housebound madwoman while his cousin was a sadistic bully who eventually sold him out to Shrike. Han did not learn about his parents, Jonash and Jaina Solo, until he reached adulthood. Solo hid the fact that he was descended from Berethron e Solo, a king of Corellia who introduced democracy to the system.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>becoming han solo</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Sometime after his father died, Han became involved with the criminal gang White Worms, serving as a scrumrat. Here, Han met fellow scrumrat Qi'ra.
<p>When Han was about the age of eighteen, Han and Qi'ra were vying for the position of Head within the White Worms. During their respective assignments, Han and Qi'ra both failed to deliver as promised, leading them to be hunted down by factions such as the White Worms, the Kaldana Syndicate, as well as the Empire. Han had acquired a datacube with plans for a shield generator that was desired by all the factions. Han and Qi'ra had no choice but to partner up to find a resolution to their problems. Eventually, Qi'ra became Head thanks to Han's recommendation to Lady Proxima. As they later ate together, Han asked if he and Qi'ra were on their first date. Qi'ra denied it, but acknowledged the possibility that it could happen someday.
<p>Sometime later, Han and Qi'ra began a romantic relationship. Acting under orders from Lady Proxima, Han set up a deal with some individuals to exchange coaxium for credits. Qi'ra suggested that Han shouldn't go alone, but both Proxima and Han disagreed with her. Upon meeting with the individuals, Han got into a fight with them due to having not abided by their stated terms and proceeded to escape with an extremely valuable vial of coaxium, as well as a speeder. Han attempted to take Qi'ra with him, but both were captured by the White Worms, and brought before crime boss Lady Proxima. Han threw a rock through a window, allowing the sunlight to burn Proxima's skin.
<p>In the confusion, Han and Qi'ra escaped to the Imperial checkpoint, where they used the coaxium to bribe the officer on duty to let them through. Han was able to make it through, but at that moment Qi'ra was spotted and the officer closed the doors. As Qi'ra was pulled away, Han promised to come back to save her. Qi'ra was captured by the White Worms, and Han began to try to find a way to save her. As he looked around the center, he spotted an Imperial recruitment center.
<p>Immediately after losing Qi'ra, Han entered the area and tried to enlist in the Imperial Navy. When asked what his last name was, Han responded that he did not have a people and was alone. Due to this he was assigned the name "Solo" by recruitment officer Drawd Munbrin. His goal was to become a skilled pilot and eventually return to Corellia to find Qi'ra.
<p>When Han enlisted, Drawd Munbrin assigned Han to the Imperial academy on the planet Carida. When Han arrived, droids stripped all his clothing off. Right after, different droids gave him his new Imperial cadet suit and also shaved him. Han entered a room filled with many other cadets. Here a female Imperial officer named Triosa Broog was speaking over them. Soon after, he tried to greet a cadet, who told Han to shut up. Han realized that when he said shut up, he used Han's cadet name, and you were only known as numbers at the Imperial Academy.
<p>At flight school, Solo's record was mixed: he earned excellent piloting marks, but his academic record was poor and he earned a number of demerits and conduct reports. His flight instructor, Alexsandr Badure, approved of him, filing a report praising Solo's abilities when he managed to land a malfunctioning U-33 orbital loadlifter by executing a number of difficult flight maneuvers, saving the lives of numerous cadets and Academy Dean Horace Wyrmyr. Student Advisor Lucinta Cal-Meg noted Solo's innate intelligence and that he worked hard to improve his academic performance. However, many also had deep reservations about Solo's judgement, conduct, and suitability for military service, as well as his friends at the Academy.
<p>Solo graduated at the top of his class with the rank of lieutenant. However, his hard-earned military career was short lived. He was dispatched to aid Commander Nyklas in duties including slaving and construction work. In this capacity, Han boarded a derelict slaving craft to find that its cargo of Wookiee children had escaped and that a badly wounded Wookiee was in the pilot's seat. Nyklas ordered Han to skin the helpless Chewbacca, but Han refused and Nyklas swore to punish the Corellian. Shortly afterward, Han and Chewbacca were put to work on the construction of a new wing of the Imperial Hall of Heroes on Coruscant by Wookiee slaves. An enraged Chewbacca turned on Nyklas, who drew his blaster on the Wookiee. Solo refused to let Chewbacca die; he stunned his commanding officer and helped Chewbacca escape, with the assistance of the Rebel Alliance. Court-martialed and dishonorably discharged, Solo returned to smuggling with Chewbacca (who had sworn a life debt to the Corellian) at his side.
<p>Solo later reflected that even without Chewbacca he probably would have left Imperial service anyway, due to the ridiculous regulations, incompetent officers and widespread anti-alien prejudice. He later became wanted for treason, with a bounty issued to his head by the Empire.
<p>Solo earned both classes of the Corellian Bloodstripe at some point during his military career, though the reasons for his first-class stripe are unknown. All that is known is that the events through which he earned them took place over several days. Because they were non-Imperial awards, they were the sole decorations that were not stripped from his uniform after his court-martial. Alexsandr Badure did later inform an interviewer that Solo's second-class bloodstripes came from an incident dealing with a Wookiee.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>smuggling career</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Initially, Han was not happy to have the big Wookiee around. He had saved Chewbacca out of remembrance of Dewlanna, but it had cost him his life's dreams. Han spent much time drinking and playing sabacc, until he was accused of cheating by an irritated Barabel named Shallamar. He probably would have been seriously injured if Chewbacca had not stepped in. After that, Han and Chewbacca grew much closer.
<p>Solo's friend Mako Spince, who had been expelled from the Academy two years before graduation, helped Solo and Chewbacca get started as smugglers. Using Nar Shaddaa as their home base, the three of them enjoyed considerable success. Solo and Chewbacca also frequently worked for the Hutt Lords Jiliac and Jabba. They piloted many of their ships, including both Hutts' personal yachts. Solo also befriended Lando Calrissian, a gambler who saved him from the notorious bounty hunter Boba Fett, and Jarik "Solo", a street urchin who claimed to be a long-lost relative. Han knew that Jarik's claim was a lie, but he took the youth under his wing anyway. He also became romantically involved with the magician Xaverri and later fellow smuggler Salla Zend. During his time with Xaverri, Han became her stage assistant, and performed across the galaxies in her shows. He also served in the other part of her work—schemes designed to hurt the Empire and Imperial officials. At one point, Han even taught Lando how to fly in a ship that would be the center of much of Han's life-the Millennium Falcon. Han had been entranced by the ship from the moment he first saw it and he wanted it more than anything else. During that test run, his dangerous flying scared Calrissian. After that, he decided that Calrissian did not deserve a ship of that quality and contemplated having the Hutts buy it for him or even stealing it for himself.
<p>Han also bought his own ship, the Bria, from Lando, and restored it to spaceworthy condition with the help of Shug Ninx. Having the Bria only made him want the Millennium Falcon even more. When the Empire sent a fleet to raze the Smuggler's Moon, Han and his friends rallied a force of smugglers and pirates to victory in the Battle of Nar Shaddaa. Shortly after the battle, as Han was paying the Imperial admiral that the Hutts had agreed to bribe in exchange for his battle plans, the Bria was destroyed by Imperial fighters. Han and Chewbacca worked again with Mako, until he was crippled during a smuggling run in the Ottega system. Solo and Chewbacca continued their career on their own.
<p>Short on cash, Han pawned his last stolen treasure from Toroenza's cache and entered the Cloud City Sabacc Tournament. Against all odds he reached the tournament finals and beat his friend Lando, winning the Millennium Falcon with his earnings. For a time afterward Han Solo and Chewbacca worked in the Corporate Sector, the Tion Hegemony, and other remote but potentially lucrative sectors of the galaxy. Part of Solo's motivation for these travels was a desire to get away from Salla Zend and her wedding plans, as he was not ready for such a commitment. Solo would later boast that he had been "from one side of the galaxy to the other."
<p>Eventually Solo and Chewbacca worked for Jabba the Hutt on occasion. They also had several run-ins with the Rebel Alliance. Senators Mon Mothma and Leia Organa became aware of Solo when he began to lead efforts to free Wookiee slaves from Kashyyyk, as a favor to Chewbacca, who had begun to lose friends and family members to the slaving effort. Solo reluctantly allowed the Alliance to help him in this effort, despite his disdain for political causes, and the Alliance soon became one of his frequent employers.
<p>After being saved from an Imperial fleet over Corellia, Han and Chewie helped plant an EMP charge on a shipment that was delivered to an Imperial facility over Corulag and helped steal Mon Calamari cruiser schematics on Carida. This last mission almost got them killed, and afterward Han swore off involvement with the Alliance and swore to keep his distance from the Galactic Civil War, until he was thrust into the center of galactic politics again after events on Tatooine.
<p>Solo's heaviest involvement with the fledgling Rebel Alliance occurred when he and other smugglers, including Lando Calrissian and Jarik Solo aided Bria Tharen's Red Hand Squadron in raiding the Ylesian colonies and putting them out of business—a plan endorsed, aided, and supported by Jabba, a business rival of Ylesia. In the subsequent battle, the Alliance forces were victorious, but several smugglers, including Jarik Solo, were killed. Han and his smuggler friends were double-crossed by Tharen who seized all the spice and treasures that were to be the smugglers' reward for the Alliance.
<p>Soon afterward, he met with Tharen again during a Hutt-sponsored treasure hunt for the Yavin Vassilika. Once again, Tharen took the prize for the Rebellion, while Solo and his smuggling associates were left with nothing. Solo and Tharen left on poor terms on both occasions, since Solo refused to give up his independent ways and join Tharen in the Alliance. However, most of his fellow smugglers assumed that he had been working with Tharen from the beginning. Even one of his closest friends, Lando Calrissian, said that he never wanted to see him again.
<p>Solo and Chewbacca had a 50,000-credit bounty placed on their head after dropping a cargo of spice they were smuggling for Jabba. They traveled to Chalmun's Cantina on Tatooine to look for work to pay off Jabba. While Chewbacca left the table, Solo took the opportunity to flirt with a B-girl named Jenny. She sat on Solo's lap and the two witnessed a bar brawl between the exiled Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and the criminals Ponda Baba and Cornelius Evazan, who had physically assaulted Luke Skywalker, leading Kenobi to cut off Baba's arm with his lightsaber. As Chewbacca joined them, Jenny realized that Solo didn't even remember her name, leading her to throw the remainder of Solo's drink in his face before storming off. Afterwards, Kenobi and Skywalker made their way to Solo's booth, Kenobi having talked with Chewie before the brawl. They arrived and began negotiating. Solo assured Kenobi that the Millennium Falcon was the fastest ship around, because it had made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. Kenobi informed Solo that the cargo was only himself, Skywalker, and two droids, and that they wanted to avoid Imperials entirely. Therefore, Solo set the price at 10,000 credits—higher than he normally would have. However, Kenobi raised Solo's bid to 17,000 credits: 2,000 in advance and 15,000 when they reached Alderaan. Solo quickly accepted the deal. The smuggler then told his temporary employer to meet him in Docking Bay 94 for departure as soon as he was ready, before warning Kenobi that some Imperial sandtroopers had entered the cantina and were looking for Evazan and Baba's attacker. Kenobi and Skywalker hastily fled, leaving Solo to express his elation to Chewbacca at having garnered such a high-paying job to pay off Jabba. Chewbacca left as well right after.
<p>As Solo got up to leave, he was confronted by one of Jabba's bounty hunters: the Rodian Greedo. Greedo demanded to be paid Jabba's debt, or he would take Solo's dead body back to Jabba as payment. Solo, then, in self defense, covertly pulled his DL-44 blaster pistol and shot Greedo from under the table a fraction of a second after Greedo fired his own weapon—though Solo hit his target and Greedo did not. Solo ignored the Murder tax Jabba enforced on Tatooine, opting instead to simply toss Wuher, the cantina's bartender, some credit chips, before apologizing for leaving a mess and then heading to Docking Bay 94.
<p>Solo arrived in the docking and found Jabba himself, with several of his guards—including Jabba's top bounty hunter Boba Fett—looking for him near the Falcon. Jabba inquired whether Solo was going to pay him, and why he had "fried poor Greedo." Jabba was disappointed in having to put the bounty on Solo, the crime lord's top smuggler. Solo insisted he had had no choice but to dump the cargo, and informed the Hutt that he had secured a charter that would be able to compensate the Hutt's loss in full as soon as he completed it. Jabba was pleased and added that if Solo paid twenty percent interest all could be forgotten, but Solo talked him down to fifteen percent, and ironically stated that the Hutt was a "wonderful Human being," before boarding the Falcon.
<p>The passengers, of course, were Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker, who meant to escort the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 from Tatooine to Alderaan on behalf of the Rebel Alliance. When they arrived in the Alderaan system, the crew and passengers of the Millennium Falcon found that the planet had been destroyed by the Death Star. After they were dragged on board by the Death Star's tractor beams, Skywalker convinced Solo and Chewbacca to help him rescue Princess Leia Organa by promising "more wealth than you can imagine." Han helped Luke infiltrate the massive station in stolen stormtrooper armor and after several misadventures, they managed to rescue the Princess and escape, at the cost of Obi-Wan's life, taken by his former apprentice, Darth Vader during their duel aboard the Death Star.
<p>Afterward, Solo took Leia, Skywalker, and the droids to Yavin 4 to collect his reward. Though he was initially willing to abandon the Rebels and make off with his fee, an attack of conscience, (brought on partly by Chewbacca's arguments) led him to join the Battle of Yavin at the last moment. The Millennium Falcon joined in just in time for Solo to destroy Black 3, which caused Black 2 to collide with and disable Darth Vader's TIE advanced. This allowed Skywalker to destroy the Death Star, scoring a major victory for the Alliance and recognition for Solo. As a result of this battle, as well as his earlier involvement in rescuing Organa, Solo and Chewbacca had a bounty placed on their heads: Specifically, Aurebesh 300,000 alive, due to their crimes of the liberation of a known criminal, direct involvement in armed revolt against the Empire, high treason, espionage, conspiracy, and the destruction of Imperial property.
<p>Han stuck with the Rebel Alliance, and helped establish its new base on the ice planet Hoth. After Luke didn’t return from a routine sweep of the planet surface, Han headed out alone into the frigid cold to find him. He finally located the young Jedi, but Luke had suffered severe injuries and was close to freezing to death. Desperate to save his friend, Han used Luke’s lightsaber to slice open his tauntaun, and placed Luke inside for warmth. The two were found by the Alliance the next morning, and Luke survived.
<p>But old problems lingered; Han was still wanted by Jabba the Hutt and had to pay off his debt. While preparing to leave, he and Leia verbally sparred. His bravado could infuriate her, but it was clear that they meant something to each other. The Empire shortly attacked the base, and Han changed his plans, evacuating Leia on the Millennium Falcon.
<p>Pursued through an asteroid field and across the stars, they sought refuge with Lando, who’d gone semi-respectable as the administrator of Cloud City. While Han believed they were now safe, things were much worse; the Empire, thanks to bounty hunter Boba Fett, had arrived just before they did. Han was tortured by Darth Vader, who used the pilot’s pain to lure Luke into a trap, and was later frozen in carbonite. Before he was lowered into the crude freezing chamber, Leia finally told Han that she loved him. “I know,” he replied. Boba Fett took the frozen Han to Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine, collecting on a long-standing reward for the former smuggler.
<p>Jabba the Hutt mounted Han’s carbonite slab to a wall in his palace, calling him his “favorite decoration.” But the ace pilot’s friends hatched a rescue mission, with Leia -- disguised as bounty hunter Boussh -- freeing Han in the middle of the night. He suffered hibernation sickness, which included temporary blindness, and their reunion would be short-lived; Jabba knew it was a trick the entire time, and captured them both. Luke Skywalker soon arrived, however, decimating the gangster’s crew and saving his friends. Han even got a bit of payback on Boba Fett, accidentally triggering the bounty hunter’s jet pack and sending him careening into the Sarlacc.
<p>Back with the Rebel Alliance, Han was promoted to general. He gave Lando the Millennium Falcon to use in the attack on the new Death Star, and volunteered to lead the mission to destroy its shield generator. He and his strike team landed on the forest moon of Endor, where they encountered scout troopers and were captured by Ewoks -- a primitive species that mistook C-3PO as a god. Han, ironically, found himself the planned main course of a banquet in the golden droid’s honor. Thanks to some quick thinking by Luke, however, the Ewoks freed the Rebels and accepted them into the tribe. It would prove to be an important alliance; the Emperor knew of the Rebels’ plan and had an entire legion of his best troops waiting. When all seemed lost, the Ewoks joined the fight -- their presence and hand-made weaponry allowing the tide of battle to turn. Han destroyed the shield generator, the Rebel forces defeated the Death Star II, and the galaxy was free once more.

<center><h3>starting a family</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Han was present when his wife gave birth to to a son named Ben Solo. Following a gathering of family and friends, Han stared into his son's eyes and pondered how he had become a father. While Leia was showering in the next room, Solo told his son that while the whole galaxy was against them, they would still make it through okay. Though Solo confided that he might not make a good father, he promised to keep them pointed in the right direction. Solo also gave Ben his first lesson: sometimes doing the right thing doesn't mean following a straight line. Solo told his baby son not to tell his mother.
<p>When Ben cried, Han tried to comfort him with a small tooka doll, but this failed to pacify the baby. Leia then heard her son crying. When Han said that it was not his fault, Leia reassured him that babies cried. Han sensed that Leia had a connection through the Force that he could never have with Ben. Han suggested using the Force, but Leia advised him to pick up their son and snuggle him. Han reluctantly snuggled his son and Ben stopped crying. When Han sighed that he could never have the same Force connection, Leia told him that fathers had a special connection with their offspring.
<p><i>*han will also recognise jacen, jaina and anakin solo as his children</i>
<p>Finding himself husband of an important politician, Han passed the time by becoming a successful racing pilot. On one occasion he returned to Corellia to compete in The Gauntlet, where he raced against Greer Sonnel and offered her a spot on his team for the Five Sabers race.
<p>In the years after the end of the Galactic Civil War, Solo became the owner of a shipping company and developed a reputation for being a vigilant and responsible owner. Outside of his work, Han often raced for charity and sponsored several piloting matches. Due to his work, Solo found himself traveling through different systems, working on ships.
<p>Their son, Ben, proved to be Force-sensitive and was sent to be trained by his uncle Luke Skywalker in the ways of the Force. Meanwhile, his wife Leia served as a prominent Senator in the Galactic Senate on Hosnian Prime, the capital of the New Republic. Han and his family lived separate lives but kept in touch with his wife via hologram.
<p>At some point after the public revelations about Leia and Ben's relationship to Darth Vader, Han's son, Ben Solo, was seduced by Supreme Leader Snoke and eventually succumbed to the dark side, killing the Jedi Luke was training. Taking the blame for Ben's fall, Luke exiled himself. Unable to cope with the loss of their son, Han and Leia separated.

<center><h3>the first order &amp; beyond</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Han and Chewbacca went back to being smugglers, which Han claimed was "the only thing he was ever good at." Meanwhile, Leia became the leader of the Resistance, a paramilitary organization aimed at fighting the First Order, which had begun to pose a threat to the New Republic. Han then got himself into a lot of debt with various creditors including the notorious Guavian Death Gang and Kanjiklub. At some point, Han and Chewbacca obtained a Baleen-class heavy freighter named the Eravana that they used for their smuggling operations and even assembled a crew to assist them. Han spent the majority of his free time trying to track down the Falcon.
<p>It is revealed that Han and Leia are aware that their son is Kylo Ren, and that their son's fall to the dark side caused them to separate, with Han returning to his smuggling business, and Leia spearheading the activities of the New Republic and the Resistance. As Starkiller Base prepared to wipe out the world of D'Qar, the site of the Resistance's headquarters, the Resistance planned an attack of their own. Finn had given them the Base's blueprints, which revealed that the base drained the energy of the sun in order to charge its superweapon, and that it required a thermal oscillator, which sustained the energy on the planet, that, if destroyed, would destabilize the planet's core and implode the Base. However, they would need to do it before the Base fully charged its weapon. Having experience in taking down superweapons' shield generators, Solo and Chewbacca volunteered to disable the shield. Before he left, Leia told Han to find their son, and convince him to reject the dark side and return to the light.
<p>Solo, Finn, and Chewie took the Millennium Falcon to Starkiller Base, exiting hyperspace inside the planet's shield just above the surface and landing just at the side of a high cliff. When Finn revealed his stationing had previously been in "sanitation" and that the real reason he had come along was to rescue Rey from the First Order, Solo and Chewbacca agreed to help him with a bit of annoyance. While inside the base, they captured Captain Phasma and forced her to lower the shields, after which Solo claimed that they would not leave the base without Rey.
<p>After finding Rey, the group headed to Starkiller Base's thermal oscillator to assist the Resistance pilots above in its destruction. While planting explosives with Chewbacca, Solo spotted Ren and confronted him on a long walkway positioned above a massive pit, where he attempted to convince his son to leave the First Order and come back with him. Ren handed his lightsaber to Solo, saying he was being "torn apart" and had one last thing to do. After a brief moment of emotional struggle, Ben activated the weapon and it passed through his own father's torso. As Rey, Finn, and Chewbacca watched in horror, Solo stroked his son's face for the last time before dying, his corpse falling over the side of the bridge and into the pit below. Leia sensed her husband's death through the Force and wept for his loss. Solo's death was later mourned by Organa, Chewbacca, and Rey when they returned to the Resistance Base from Starkiller Base after its destruction.

<center><h3>the force has a sense of humour</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>It’s not known exactly when but at some point Han found himself returned to the land of the living. The last thing he remembered was the feeling of his son’s lightsabre going through him and the life quickly rushing from him. Now he’s walking the galaxy again and his first instinct is to find the Falcon. After that it’s to find his friends, his wife, and if his son is still alive, to find Ben. Solo still doesn’t quite understand how it is he returned to life nor is he going to question it. He plans on enjoying his second chance at life even if it means he’s once again on his own again.

<center><h3>personality traits</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Han Solo was known for his cockiness, dry wit, rudeness, piloting skills, and his fast draw. He also had an affinity for Sabacc and other gambling games. He often boasted of his achievements he made in his ship the Millennium Falcon, such as making the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs, and being able to outrun Imperial Star Destroyers. Captain Solo was quite the mechanic, having made countless modifications to the Falcon alongside Chewie. He once said he preferred to shoot first as opposed to shooting second, and used to his advantage on at least one occasion the fact that he was ambidextrous. Han Solo was also one of the few people to evade Boba Fett on multiple occasions. During the Second Galactic Civil War, when he began to distrust the New Jedi Order because of his beliefs that Corellia should be able to have independence, Leia often referred to him as "the most dangerous man in the galaxy".
<p>He also was initially a cynical, disagreeable individual whose primary concern was gaining enough money to preserve his own life. He and Luke immediately disliked each other: Solo found Luke irritating and overly eager, and his open disdain for Kenobi's beliefs and actions did little to change Luke's initial view of Solo as an extortionist. However, after Han demonstrated his bravery on the Death Star and proved his loyalty, they became genuine friends, and soon after, Han became loyal to the Rebellion. Aside from his seemingly self-centered ways, Han was actually very loyal to his friends, and a good man. Having endured a difficult childhood as an impoverished orphan with no identity, Han instantly related to the Jakku scavenger Rey, who shared some of his skills.
<p>Han's wife, Leia, described him as someone who had no patience for speeches or memorials, and was allergic to politics and suspicious of causes. However, according to Leia, he also hated bullies and could never stand down when confronted with them, and when he took on a difficult mission, he was never interested in knowing the odds of success. As Leia recognized, Han's first instinct was always to run when things got hard, but that he never ran far and always came back and stepped up again, knowing that there was a time to run and a time to make a stand.
<p>Han was not known to be Force-sensitive, unlike his wife, children and many of his friends, although due to his experience with the Force via his friends and family, he was Force-attuned. Despite his family and frequent companions including some of the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy, Han was far from helpless in comparison. His ability to think up inventive and often extremely unorthodox solutions to problems on the fly proved to be a constant source of frustration to all enemies he encountered (and often his friends). This, combined with Han's peerless skill at the hands of the Millennium Falcon as well as the legendary "Solo Luck" more than compensated for any lack of Force sensitivity. 
<p>He was, however, a man with insecurities as well. He was overprotective of his ship and hated times when the Falcon was modified or repaired too much, especially by droids, as tight bolts on the craft wouldn't let him feel how hard they were hit by laser fire, resulting in him loosening several of them around the ship. He was also hesitant to let Chewbacca, Lando or anyone else fly it. Han also vowed jokingly to never give the codes for the Falcon to his son Jacen, at least not in his lifetime.
<p>Among the multiple skills he developed during his early career, Han Solo became familiar with the practice and details of dishwashing.
<p>Han Solo was known to dislike droids and discouraged them from travelling in his ship, although he relented in certain circumstances. After he joined the Rebellion, he allowed C-3PO and R2-D2 free access to the Falcon, as a special case and in attention to Luke Skywalker's and Leia Organa's wishes; Solo nevertheless rarely had a good word to any of the droids.
<p>He had a particular distaste for "bugs", as he revealed during the Swarm War, probably due to the run-in with Kamarian religious fanatics early in his smuggling career. Han also had a loud snore which bothered Leia.
<p>In addition to speaking his native Basic, Solo fluently understood many other languages, including Shyriiwook, Trader's argot Rodese, Illodian, and Huttese. He could also imperfectly speak Mandaba, the Selonian language. Although he spoke Basic with a Corellian accent for much of his life, he had developed more of a Coruscanti accent.
<p>Han Solo initially found the task of fatherhood challenging. While he envied Leia's Force connection to their son, Ben Solo, Han found that he had a special bond as a father. Due to their different interests and personalities, Solo and his wife lived separate lives. While she served as a New Republic senator, Solo managed a shipping company and organized starship races. Still, Solo kept in regular contact with his wife. On one occasion, he rescued Leia from a pro-Imperial militia known as the Amaxine warriors.
<p>Solo and Leia took their son's descent to the dark side badly. Their marriage collapsed, and the two separated. With his shipping business floundering, Han resumed smuggling and incurred large debts with the criminal gangs Kanjiklub and the Guavian Death Gang. Solo regained his purpose when the scavenger Rey and the former stormtrooper Finn sought his help in smuggling the droid BB-8, who was carrying a Map to Skywalker, to the Resistance. After reconciling with his wife, General Leia, Solo decided to try to bring his son back. Despite an emotional reunion between father and son, Kylo Ren killed his father. Han's death devastated Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey, who had come to view him as a father figure. BB-8 would then remember Solo as a "maniac," to which R2-D2 clarified that Solo was "one of the best maniacs." Kylo himself would admit to being devastated by Han's death, telling Rey that he still loved his father. After nearly dying, it would be a vision of Han that ultimately drove Ben back to the light side

<center><h3>headcanons</h3></center>
<div id="hc"><p>&#9642; <b>parenting/family:</b> a family isn’t something han ever thought about having. growing up in a gang isn’t the sort of thing that prepares anyone for the concept of a family, of children, of any sort of normal life. if anything it taught him that when things got rough or when there was something he couldn’t easily fix that he was better off running than sticking around. but the moment he held his children in his arms for the first time he knew that being a father was what he wanted. in his children he saw a life that he never did, he saw the hopes and dreams of better things for them and he found himself amazed at just how much love he held for one person. love wasn’t something he really understood. he thought he loved plenty of times in the past but he never knew. not until he held his children in his arms.
<p>unfortunately, because of his past he struggled with being the sort of father he felt like his children deserved. when ben was born and started to cry he thought he had just the answer in a small little doll. instead, his son continued to cry until leia came back and soothed them. in that moment he knew that he would never have the connection to his son or any of his other children that their mother did. han never saw his lack of connection to the force as a bad thing. having spent enough time around those who did he knew that he was stronger for not having it. but with ben and his other children he saw that what he thought of was strength was anything but. in that moment he cemented in his head that he would never have a strong connection, that he’d never be able to have the strong father/son bond that leia would have with their kids.
<p>over time that mentality started to grow to the point there was no coming back. instead of sticking around and making an attempt at being a good father, at strengthening the bond he already had with ben, han threw himself back into smuggling and his racing business. he figured that leia would be the better parent, that she could handle things given the fact she was able to handle the galactic senate and being a mother at the same time. it never even crossed his mind that things weren’t okay at home, that his presence would’ve done more good than harm and that his son was struggling. in his mind he truly thought he was better off keeping his distance instead of making the family he had worse. it’s only when he comes face to face with his son, with kylo ren, that he realises what his actions did and how there is no way for him to fix all of that.
<p>while he hadn’t gone to meet with his son with the intentions of dying, he knew that it was a strong possibility. he also knew that if he was going to die he would rather it be at the hands of his own flesh and blood than with someone he accidentally crossed paths with.

<center><h3>early life</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Born on the planet Dathomir during the final decades of the Galactic Republic, Asajj was a Dathomirian who was a member of a clan of Nightsisters led by Mother Talzin. While Ventress was still an infant, her clan came under a threat associated with the Siniteen criminal Hal'Sted. In order to ensure her clan's safety, Mother Talzin arranged for Asajj's mother to give her up to Hal'Sted, who took her away from Dathomir to be raised as a slave on the planet Rattatak. At the same time, Asajj was raised by the Ventresses, a powerful native Rattataki warlord family who had most likely given her the surname.
<p>By 39 BBY, when Ventress was still a toddler, Mandalorian Meltch Krakko, who knew of her origins, heard about her turning into "quite the warrior." However, the young girl could not save Hal'Sted, who was killed during an assault by Weequay raiders, nor could she have rescued her foster parents. As she grieved over her loss, Asajj would have most likely died if it weren't for the arrival of a Jedi Knight named Ky Narec, who had been stranded on Rattatak after his starship crashed. Just when he was ambushed by a Weequay raider, Asajj used the Force to throw the raider into the air. Sensing Ventress's connection to the Force, Narec took the child into his care and decided to train her as his Padawan, despite being cut off from the rest of the Jedi Order.
<p>The Master and Padawan duo became heroes to the people, ending wars and uniting rival armies. But tales and rumors of Ventress's new powers—her ability to move things with her mind and influence the minds of others—concerned the other warlords. Under Osika Kirske's leadership, they banded together to kill Ventress and her mentor. The warlords managed to kill Narec, but the pain of his loss, combined with Ventress's own undisciplined skills, sent her spiraling down the path toward the dark side of the Force.
<p>When Narec died at the hands of a Weequay raider, Ventress tattooed her head and left her innocence behind. Her skull was striped with twelve marks, one for each of the twelve warlords she had killed after swearing their deaths. She then hunted down the warlords using a blood trail technique to track them. She developed a hatred of the Jedi, whom she believed had abandoned Narec.
<p>Shortly afterwards, Ventress became a bounty hunter in the hopes of testing her prowess against a Jedi. But such an opportunity never came to being. Around that time, she had learned of the Jedi's most ancient enemy, the Sith. One day, she vowed, she would become a Sith herself and make the Jedi pay for what they had done to her.

<center><h3>the clone wars</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>By the time Ventress established a stronghold on some part of Rattatak, the Clone Wars had begun. After Echuu Shen-Jon killed Sev'rance Tann on Krant, Count Dooku, alias Darth Tyranus, went in search of a new acolyte to serve as a commander in the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He traveled to Rattatak, where he was met by a waiting humanoid co-conspirator. As he sat beside the Count in a nearby observation chamber, this robed individual was silently and swiftly dispatched by a dark, cloaked figure who then took his seat. Dooku noted the presence of the killer, but initially voiced doubt about her combat abilities—until Ventress threw herself into a gladiatorial pit fight in the Cauldron and easily annihilated such foes as Blorga, Grunda Dolma, Nilo, L8-L9, Flalios, Jasper McKnives, Krutch, Anchor Blue, Swyy'm-Ee, and finally Giant Flog.
<p>Dooku applauded Ventress's talents, but she then went too far by declaring herself a Sith, and claimed that Dooku knew nothing of the dark side. Dooku decided to "enlighten" her. After rendering her unconscious with a blast of Force lightning and later defeating her in a duel, Dooku presented her to his Master, Darth Sidious, who approved his choice and ordered her to kill Anakin Skywalker. After her departure, Sidious told Tyranus that it was irrelevant whether or not Ventress succeeded. Either way, Sidious won. In fact, events turned out better than even he had planned. Not only did Skywalker draw on his rage, but Ventress survived and the Sith gained a valuable assassin.
<p>Before sending her on her way, Dooku gifted Ventress with the twin red blades of his former Padawan, Komari Vosa. The twin blades could be wielded separately or joined together to form a saberstaff, albeit one more difficult to handle than the traditional design, given the curved nature of the handles. Dooku, having taken the blades from Vosa after her fatal fight with the late bounty hunter Jango Fett, now intended that Ventress should use them—much as Komari Vosa had—to be a bane to the forces of the light.
<p>Shortly after gaining her new lightsabers, Ventress raised an army and took control of the land once held by the warlords who had murdered Ky Narec. She had a castle built on Rattatak, from where she controlled her new kingdom and kept Narec's lightsaber as a memento of the good times with her fallen mentor.

<center><h3>betrayal &amp; loss</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>As the war dragged on Ventress continued her service to Dooku while steadily becoming more powerful in the dark side of the Force, a fact that came to greatly concern Dooku's Sith master, Darth Sidious. Shortly after the Republic approved an effort to enhance and expand its military capabilities, Ventress led a sizable Confederate battle group to the Sullust system, where she and the tactical droid TJ-912 directed their forces in a showdown against a Republic fleet led by Kenobi, Skywalker, and Admiral Wullf Yularen. Ventress's fleet, consisting of her Providence-class dreadnought, Recusant-class light destroyers, and Munificent-class star frigates, launched a vicious attack against the Republic's forces over Sullust. Many Republic ships were overwhelmed by Vulture droids and Separatist tri-fighters, and Ventress herself joined the fray in her personal Ginivex-class fanblade starfighter. The tri-fighters of Trident Groups One and Two followed the dark-side apprentice in an assault on Yularen's flagship, the Venator-class destroyer Resolute. Under her orders, Group One targeted the Resolute's starboard engines, and Group Two fired on the ship's port-side deflector shield generators; the coordinated assault allowed Ventress to navigate her starfighter through the Resolute's turbolaser defenses and blast the destroyer's port-side command bridge. The Resolute was crippled in the assault and was ultimately destroyed under Separatist fire, though Admiral Yularen managed to escape.
<p>As Ventress pressed her attack, she and her droid squadrons located and intercepted Kenobi and Skywalker's Jedi starfighters. She quickly fired on Kenobi's ship, driving the two Jedi to diverge from one another to split their attackers' attention. While the tri-fighters followed after Skywalker's fighter, Ventress tailed Kenobi and continued to fire on his ship, gradually crippling its systems. After chasing the Jedi through the battle theater and around a Venator-class destroyer, Ventress nearly killed Kenobi but instead came under fire from Skywalker, who had managed to evade and destroy his tri-fighter pursuers. Ventress's Ginivex-class starfighter was badly damaged and she was forced to follow Kenobi into a crash landing in the hangar of her Providence-class dreadnought.
<p>Unbeknownst to Ventress, Dooku had been confronted about his apprentice by Darth Sidious during the battle. Although her master attempted to assuage the Dark Lord's concern, Sidious was convinced that Ventress was being trained as a means to overthrow him and insisted that Dooku kill her. The count reluctantly complied and decided that Sullust would be where Ventress would meet her end. When Ventress contacted Dooku from within the cockpit of her downed fighter to request assistance, he rejected his apprentice and left her to die. Injured and with her reinforcements ordered to abandon the battle theater, Ventress emerged from her ship to face the Jedi alone. In a refusal to surrender, she dueled the two aggressively across the hangar.
<p>Although she managed to separate the Jedi for a moment, she was quickly overwhelmed and cornered against her own starfighter. In a burst of dark-side aggression, Ventress seized both in a Force choke but was interrupted when TJ-912—under orders from Count Dooku—opened fire on Ventress's command ship from the droid's Recusant-class destroyer. As the Providence dreadnought rocked under the assault, the battle in the hangar was thrown into chaos. Ventress was disarmed by the Jedi and nearly taken down when a damaged Hyena-class droid bomber performed a suicide run on the dreadnought hangar. The three combatants jumped away from the impact, and the Jedi decided to flee the doomed command vessel and leave Ventress to go down with the ship.
<p>Again left for dead at the Battle of Sullust, Ventress scurried aboard her crippled starfighter and drove it along the hangar floor towards the airlock, escaping the Providence-class destroyer just as it detonated under continued fire. The explosion destroyed much of the remaining Confederate fleet and won the battle for the Republic, leaving behind only debris and an unconscious Asajj Ventress in the charred hull of her disabled Ginivex-class starfighter. TJ-912 reported to Dooku that scans showed no survivors, leaving the count and Lord Sidious convinced that the Dathomirian assassin had met her end.
<p>The remains of Ventress's ship and her unconscious body were eventually discovered by a salvage ship, the Raider. The scavengers aboard, who had been picking through the debris field in the aftermath of the battle, took the Fanblade starfighter as a prize and pulled Ventress from the wreckage. The scavenger captain Ratch and his crew resuscitated the woman and began interrogating her about the battle at knifepoint, but the injured and betrayed Ventress refused to answer questions, instead demanding to be taken to Dathomir. When Ratch questioned her demands, she seized the Twi'lek captain and his three crewmen in a Force choke that killed them almost instantly. Knowing that the Confederacy was no longer her cause and the Republic was still her enemy, Ventress took command of the Raider and set course for her long-lost homeworld in the Mid Rim.

<center><h3>return to dathomir</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Ventress arrived at the sparsely populated planet and set the Raider down just outside of the Nightsister fortress-village. As she approached on foot she was surrounded by a cadre of witches who failed to recognize their sister and threatened her as an unwelcome stranger. The injured and exhausted Ventress was saved by the intervention of Mother Talzin, who knew the woman was the young Nightsister child she had given away decades prior. Ventress, overcome by her wounds, collapsed into Talzin's arms and was carried into the village by her sisters. Her body was placed on a stone slab while Talzin directed the Nightsisters to gather basins containing the Water of Life—a liquid ichor that was infused with the magick of Dathomir and aided in Nightsister rituals. The coven encircled Ventress with the Waters while Talzin led them in a shamanistic ritual intended to heal the assassin. During the ceremony, the dark magicks caused Ventress to experience vivid and painful visions of her past—her transfer to Hal'Sted and his eventual murder, her training under Ky Narec and his eventual murder, and ultimately her tutelage under Dooku and his attempted murder of Ventress herself. Her last vision of Dooku abandoning her at Sullust made Ventress realize what she needed most: revenge.
<p>Ventress emerged from her unconscious state to find Talzin by her bedside. The Clan Mother had hoped Ventress would have returned to Dathomir sooner, but was prepared to aid her long-lost clanswoman nonetheless. Although Talzin was acquainted with Dooku and ostensibly on cordial terms, she hated the Sith Order and its adherents. Decades prior, she had been a confidant and aspiring student of Darth Sidious, but the Dark Lord ultimately betrayed the Nightsister shaman by abducting and indoctrinating her young son and leaving the witch to her fate on Dathomir. And so in Talzin, Ventress found a new mentor and ally in her vendetta against Dooku. The Clan Mother pledged Nightsisters Karis and Naa'leth—the coven's greatest warriors—to Ventress's cause and set out to plan the assassination of Count Dooku.
<p>Ventress hid out with the Nightsisters for a short time after her healing, gathering strength and becoming familiar with her people's attire and customs. Meanwhile, Talzin prepared her assassination plot. She summoned her coven to the village center and greeted Ventress with a prayer circle and an enchanted basin of ichor. Using her coven's spellcasting abilities, Talzin had imbued the liquid with the magick powers of stealth. Ventress, Karis, and Naa'leth stepped into the mist rising from the ichor and became nearly invisible. Their forms were cloudy and translucent, allowing the three Dathomirians easily be camouflaged in any environment. Ventress and her compatriots were given Jedi lightsabers by Talzin, who planned for the three women to strike at Dooku in his palace on the planet Serenno. The lightsabers ensured that if the three were seen, the would appear to be Jedi assailants and not Nightsister assassins.
<p>Ventress flew the Raider to Serenno with Karis and Naa'leth in tow, landing in the forests on the outskirts of Dooku's compound. Under the cover of night, the three women trekked to the palace and infiltrated it by cutting through the outer wall and crawling through the ducts. Ventress sensed her old master in his room below them and descended upon a sleeping Dooku with her cadre. Before engaging, she shot him with a dart that had been dipped in Nightsister poison by Talzin. The count immediately woke and armed himself with his lightsaber, but quickly began to lose his vision as a result of the poison. Nevertheless he attacked his assailants, who he assumed to be Jedi on the basis of their lightsaber blades. Ventress, Karis, and Naa'leth went in on the Sith Lord, striking to kill their target who remained a dangerous and talented foe despite his impairments. The duel eventually moved into Dooku's office, where the count faltered and was slammed into his desk by a powerful Force push from Ventress. The Dathomirian nearly took the Sith Lord's life, but Dooku surprised his three assassins with a sudden and overwhelming wave of Force lightning. The blast incapacitated all three Nightsisters, lifting them into the air and allowing Dooku to fling them through his window and out of the palace towards the forests below. Ventress fell for a long distance but swiftly regained her bearings and clung to a cliffside to avoid impact on the ground. She grabbed Karis and Naa'leth's tumbling bodies through the Force and rescued them too before returning to the Raider and fleeing Serenno in defeat.
<p>The Raider flew back to Dathomir where the assassins were greeted by Talzin and the coven. Karis admitted their failure, but the Clan Mother insisted that the defeat presented additional opportunities. She explained to Ventress that their failed assassination demonstrated to Dooku his own vulnerability, and that the Sith Lord would now be eager to protect himself—specifically, by finding a new pupil with which to replace Ventress. To that end, Talzin contacted her old acquaintance and offered the count a new apprentice. Dooku had always acknowledged Ventress's talents and the power of Dathomirian warriors, and so accepted the offer to take a new apprentice from Talzin's people—this time from the subordinate but ferocious male warrior clans of Dathomir, the Nightbrothers.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>the nightbrother</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Not long after the assassination attempt, Dooku traveled to Dathomir to hold audience with Talzin and discuss the Nightsister's offer. Ventress hid among her sisters during the meeting but monitored her old Master until his departure from the planet. Talzin had promised to find Dooku a new assassin from the ranks of the Nightbrothers and assured him that the warrior would be of the same bloodline as Darth Maul. Maul had been a renowned Sith Lord a decade prior during his time as Darth Sidious's apprentice; after he was reported dead at the hands of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Dooku replaced him as the Dark Lord's pupil, but his legend lived on. It was that legend that motivated the count to agree to the arrangement, unaware that Talzin was conspiring with Ventress to ensure that his new assassin would be a weapon against Dooku that was loyal only to the Nightsisters. Unbeknownst to all parties but the Nightsister shaman herself, Darth Maul was the young son of Talzin's who had been abducted and indoctrinated by Darth Sidious so many years prior. Talzin's aid to Ventress in maneuvering against the Sith was motivated by loyalty to her son and her desire to revive him and strike back against the Sith Lord. Thus, she sent Ventress off aboard a speeder towards the Nightbrother village on the far side of the planet to find one of Maul's kinsman to be her proxy and Ventress's pawn in taking down Dooku.
<p>At the village, Ventress met the Nightbrother chieftain Viscus and informed him that she had arrived to perform the Selection—a Dathomiri ritual by which Nightsisters tested their own skills and in which Nightbrothers were selected for mating. Viscus summoned the heads of each Nightbrother clan to the village square, where the men lined up to be inspected by the Nightsister. Taking full advantage of her dominant social status, Ventress began to beat and berate several of the Nightbrothers to demonstrate that many were unfit for consideration. After dismissing several undesirables, she selected a group of six potential candidates, making sure to single out two in particular: Savage Opress and his brother Feral.
<p>The warriors' first trial would also serve as an initiation assessment for Ventress—the Test of Fury was the first part of the Selection process, but was also a necessary rite for Nightsisters to become full-fledged assassins in their culture. In an open circular arena high above the village, Ventress and Viscus gathered the six candidates and armed them with a variety of deadly melee weapons. At Viscus's signal, the men attacked the unarmed Nightsister, who easily dodged their assaults and assailed them with her bare hands. Ventress killed two of the Nightbrothers in the vicious scuffle and incapacitated the other three. Opress was the last warrior standing, but she knocked him out with a swift punch after he chose to rush to Feral's aid instead of continuing the attack.
<p>Night fell on Dathomir as Ventress and Viscus began the second test of the selection. In a challenge of blindness, Ventress wielded a flail and hid in the darkness from the four remaining warriors, occasionally using the Force to quickly and quietly speed towards them in an ambush. Her first two attacks were successful and killed two of the candidates, but Opress was able to predict the angle of the third attack and pull himself and Feral away from Ventress's deadly strike. Impressed, she accepted the two brothers into the third and final test in which she would fight them to the death on ceremonial platforms that raised and lowered unpredictably. The brothers did not want to fight one another for survival and so attempted to evade Ventress together, but Feral was discovered and attacked by the Nightsister when he was separated from Savage. Ventress nearly killed Feral, first beating him into submission and then seizing him in a Force choke. She was prevented from doing so by Opress, who threw her against a pillar and demanded that she take him and spare his brother. Ventress accepted the offer and ordered Feral to leave before continuing battle against Opress. The two were well-matched in martial combat but the Nightsister ultimately overcame her opponent after brutally beating him to the ground. With her foot on his throat she proclaimed Opress the victor of the Selection and took ownership of him as a slave.
<p>The following day, Ventress departed from the village with Opress in tow to return to the Nightsister fortress. She presented the man to Mother Talzin, who praised her selection of such a fine specimen. Opress was sedated under Talzin's influence and brought to the village center, where he was subjected to the dark magicks of the gathered witch clan. Ventress watched as the coven used the Spirit Ichor to transform the man's body, infusing him with dark power and enhancing his natural rage and hatred. Opress grew from an average-sized Zabrak warrior into a hulking monster with little free will or compassion left within. When the ritual was complete, Talzin reawakened Opress, who immediately grabbed Ventress's neck and began to crush her throat with overwhelming strength. Although he initially ignored her protestations, Talzin's magick made him obedient to the Nightsister in the proper context, and so Ventress was able to order him to release her with a calm and soft command.
<p>To ensure his loyalty to her above all else, Ventress brought forth Feral, who had been abducted from the Nightbrother village after Opress was selected and taken away. Ventress ordered Savage to kill Feral to prove his obedience and merciless nature; although he hesitated briefly, Opress ultimately grabbed his brother by the throat and strangled him to death. Assured of her pawn's allegiance and skill, Ventress allowed Talzin to take Opress to Dooku on Serenno, where he would be apprenticed to the count and train in the dark side of the Force. Still believing Ventress to have been killed at Sullust, Dooku took the Nightbrother into his inner circle and began planning to overthrow Sidious and conquer the galaxy with his new student—just as he once had with Ventress. While she remained with the Nightsisters on Dathomir, her pawn grew stronger in the Force under the count's teachings and began to undertake missions on behalf of the Confederacy. The first of these missions saw Opress brutally kill two Jedi on Devaron, forcing the Jedi High Council to launch an investigation that ultimately led Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to Mother Talzin on Dathomir. Talzin, realizing that Opress could no longer be kept a secret from the galaxy and not wanting to incriminate herself or her clan, complied with the Jedi. After Kenobi and Skywalker departed Dathomir to intercept Opress at Toydaria, Ventress met with Talzin to discuss their progress. Although the younger woman believed that her assassination plot was not yet prepared, Talzin insisted that she needed to strike now, as Opress had been revealed to the galaxy. Ventress agreed and set off for Toydaria to reclaim Opress as her own and finally kill Count Dooku.
<p>While Opress was on the planet to retrieve King Katuunko alive and force him into an agreement with the Separatists—thereby correcting Ventress's failure on Rugosa—he was intercepted by Kenobi and Skywalker and ended up killing the Toydarian monarch. Ventress meanwhile infiltrated the Confederate Providence-class destroyer in orbit, which had ferried Dooku to the system to parley with his intended captive. When Opress returned to the count's observation chamber with Katuunko's corpse, the Sith Lord punished his student for his failure with relentless blasts of Force lightning. Ventress shocked both of them when she interrupted the torture and once more took command of Opress and the two students turned against their former teacher. A vicious duel ensued, with Dooku just barely fending off attacks from the Dathomirian warriors. Although the count was at a severe disadvantage and was even disarmed at one point, he was able to hold off Opress by repeatedly attacking him with Force lightning. Ventress bristled at her pawn's inability to strike at Dooku and began berating him for his weakness; the derision from Ventress and torture from Dooku was ultimately too much for the Nightbrother to handle, and so he broke free from his bonds of servitude and attacked both of his masters. As the duel devolved into a three-way brawl, Dooku escaped the fray by fleeing into a trap door in the floor. Ventress gave pursuit, leaving Opress in the count's observation chamber, where he was discovered by Kenobi and Skywalker, who were still tracking him for his murder of the Jedi on Devaron.
<p>Ventress followed Dooku into the lower levels of the destroyer where she once again confronted her former Master. The two continued their duel throughout the vessel and into the escape pod bays, where Dooku ended the confrontation by throwing the Nightsister into a bulkhead and disarming her with telekinetic Force. He poured a blast lightning into her body and moved to execute her with a swift downward strike, but Ventress was able to narrowly avoid death by using the Force to push his blade into the piping beside her instead. Harsh gasses flowed out of the severed pipe and into Dooku's face, allowing Ventress just enough time to retrieve her lightsabers and flee into a nearby escape pod. The pod's path took her down towards Toydaria, after which she fled into the galaxy to hide from Dooku, Opress, the Jedi, the Confederacy, and the Republic.

<center><h3>dooku's revenge</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>The debacle at Toydaria rattled Ventress, who took to wandering the stars for a time to contemplate her next moves. As the war dragged on elsewhere and much of the galaxy still believed her to be dead, Ventress decided that the time had come to return to Dathomir and make it her home. She traveled back to the planet aboard an HH-87 Starhopper and was greeted by her sisters and Mother Talzin upon her arrival. She explained to Talzin what had happened with Opress and voiced uncertainty over her own future now that revenge against Dooku appeared to be out of reach. Despite having an agenda of her own with Opress—specifically, the recovery of her son, Darth Maul—Talzin welcomed Ventress back without hesitation and offered to make her an official member of the coven by performing the baptismal ritual. Ventress agreed, thereby leaving behind her identity as an assassin and embracing her new life as a Nightsister. In the dark ichor-infused waters of the coven's fortress, the witches gathered around to perform the ceremony. After Ventress repeated a pledge to her honor her sisters with loyalty above all else, she was bathed in the waters while her sisters performed the magick ritual to rebirth her as a true Sister of the Night.
<p>Ventress was risen from the waters at the conclusion of the ceremony and declared a Nightsister by Mother Talzin, who called for a feast to celebrate the formal return of their long-lost sister. Unbeknownst to the Dathomirians, far away on Serenno, Count Dooku was still plotting to eliminate his former apprentice and deliver retribution unto the Nightsisters for harboring her and baiting him with Opress. To that end, he dispatched General Grievous and an armada of droid forces to Dathomir to wipe out the Nightsisters and Mother Talzin once and for all. During the celebration of her baptism, Ventress recognized the familiar sound of droid starfighters and realized before the rest that the coven was under assault. She ordered her sisters to scatter just as Vulture droids and Hyena bombers made their first attack runs on the fortress. Understanding that the Confederacy had come to Dathomir to end the Nightsisters, Talzin ordered her clan to prepare for battle while Ventress readied herself to lead the fight. The droids continued their bombing runs against the fortress, downing support structures and crushing Sister Karis. Ventress took a moment to mourn before rushing into the fray against the first wave of droids, leading her sisters in an offensive against the invading army.
<p>At her command, bow-wielding Nightsisters took to the trees to attack from above while Ventress led the assault against droid infantry forces on the ground. The witches gained ground under her leadership until Grievous launched organic-incinerating defoliator missiles against the Dathomirians. They were briefly forced to retreat until they were joined by reinforcements: an army of undead Nightsisters resurrected by the eldest sister, Old Daka. With the aid of these zombified sisters, the Nightsisters overwhelmed the droids and Ventress was able to commandeer an Armored Assault Tank. After destroying the Defoliator Deployment Tanks threatening her people, she drove the commandeered tank directly towards Grievous's staging area with the Army of the Dead clearing a path. Upon reaching the general's landing craft, Ventress abandoned her tank and leaped over waves of battle droids while her sisters laid waste to the automatons behind her. She was greeted at the ships by Grievous and insisted that if she was the target of the invasion, then the two should face one another in a duel—if Grievous were to win, then the Nightsisters would surrender, but if Ventress was victorious then the Confederate army was to leave. Grievous agreed, but after Ventress overcame him in a short bout, he ordered his forces to kill her and all of her sisters.
<p>His sudden reneging on the terms of the duel threw the battle into chaos, in which Ventress was shot in the shoulder by a droid. The remaining Nightsisters attacked the droids, with the Army of the Undead tackling Grievous and narrowly saving Ventress from execution by the general. The Nightsister Luce grabbed the wounded Ventress and began carrying her away from the battle but was shot in the back by droids and killed in the act. Advised by her savior to flee in the face of their impending doom, Ventress limped into the forest while the Army of the Undead and the remaining Nightsisters were wiped out. Grievous ultimately made his way into the Nightsister fortress itself, where he murdered Old Daka and forced Talzin to escape execution by phasing out of the fortress via magic. In the aftermath of the battle, Ventress wandered the Dathomirian wilderness alone and injured until she was confronted by the specter of Mother Talzin, communicating from the realm of spirits. The clan mother informed her that the battle was lost, and although Ventress blamed herself for the eradication of the Nightsisters, Talzin encouraged her to continue her life before again dissipating in a green mist. Devastated, Ventress screamed for Talzin to return but was instead left alone in the forest to forge her own path yet again.

<center><h3>the exile's life</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>A devastated Ventress eventually made it off of Dathomir and took to wandering the Outer Rim Territories. Posing as a traveler on a vagabond transport, she made her way to the lawless desert world of Tatooine where she would be largely anonymous among the seedy spaceport city of Mos Eisley. While attempting to drink through her sorrows in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, Ventress was propositioned by the bounty hunter Oked, who she soundly dismissed. When he continued to harass her despite being rejected, she casually impaled him with her lightsaber and continued drinking. Though violence was commonplace in the cantina, Oked's murder attracted the attention of the Trandoshan Bossk and the Theelin Latts Razzi, both fellow bounty hunters. They summoned Ventress to their table and informed her that Oked had been a member of their syndicate of hunters, and that they now needed a replacement for their upcoming job. Bossk insisted that Ventress join in Oked's place given that she was the reason for the newly opened position, and having no other direction or plan, Ventress agreed.
<p>Bossk and Razzi escorted Ventress to their Mos Eisley safehouse, where she was introduced to the other three members of the bounty hunting team: Dengar, the human cyborg; the combat droid C-21 Highsinger; and their leader, Boba Fett. Ventress made her displeasure at having to answer to the adolescent Fett known immediately, and although the young man wanted her thrown off the team, Razzi reminded him that their upcoming job required six hunters. Fett accepted Ventress's membership out of necessity, despite her refusal to take orders or reveal her identity to the team. Together, the five bounty hunters and Ventress departed Tatooine aboard Bossk's ship, the Hound's Tooth, and made way for their target on the planet Quarzite. The team arrived at the world's skyhook space station, where they were greeted by the Belugan Major Rigosso, a representative of the Belugan dictator of Quarzite, Otua Blank. Rigosso explained to the team that, due to the world's completely pressurized atmosphere, he and the hunters would travel from the station to the inhabited subsurface of Quarzite via the skyhook's turbolifts. There they would find their objective: precious cargo that was to be protected from marauders as it was delivered to Blank's fortress via subtram.
<p>Ventress rode to the crystalline subsurface with Dengar, where the two of them and the rest of the team were joined by members of Rigosso's guard. The major insisted that the cargo container not be opened by any of the hunters before he and Fett's crew boarded the subtram and began their journey towards the fortress. The team split up along the tram, with Ventress and Dengar being assigned to guard the rear platform from attack. Dengar attempted to make conversation but was interrupted by three Kage Warriors—the marauders who opposed Blank that Rigosso had warned them about. Ventress and Dengar engaged the warriors, but four more quickly appeared and ran towards the front of the tram. The other hunters successfully repelled this first wave, but more Kage continually boarded from Milodon mounts running alongside the subtram. Ventress held off three attackers using only unarmed combat, but activated her lightsabers after the warriors drew their own blades. Dengar was overwhelmed by the assault and fell off the tram, leaving Ventress to fend off the invaders on the back of the tram alone. Although she requested aid, Bossk, Razzi, and C-21 Highsinger were all thrown off as well, and Major Rigosso was killed by the warriors' leader, Krismo Sodi. After eliminating all combatants on the tram's rear, Ventress made her way towards the cargo compartment that was now manned only by Fett. There she discovered Krismo Sodi standing over an unconscious Fett and Otua Blank's newly freed cargo: Pluma Sodi, sister to the Warriors' leader. Ventress demanded that Krismo step aside so she could claim her bounty, but the Kage instead released a smoke bomb and hid in the darkened recesses of the cabin, only to ambush and disarm Ventress moments later. The two engaged in a vicious fistfight that was ended when the Dathomirian seized her opponent's throat with the Force and slammed him against the wall and thew him across the tram. Fett awoke moments later, oblivious to Ventress's display of Force power. He ordered that he tie up Krismo and Pluma so the two of them could complete the objective and collect their reward.
<p>Ventress was assigned to guard the prisoners for the final leg of their journey aboard the tram, during which time Pluma Sodi attempted to appeal to her better nature, explaining that she had been ripped away from her family and home. Ventress sympathized with the young woman, but still intended to make the delivery and collect half the bounty until Fett revealed that she would only get a small cut while he would receive the majority share. Ventress lost patience with the young hunter during their argument and grabbed him in a Force choke—a display that shocked Fett. Having been swayed by Sodi and displeased by Fett, Ventress decided to deliver a different cargo to Otua Blank. She bound and gagged Fett and stowed him away in the cargo box that had previously held Pluma Sodi and delivered the container on her own to Otua Blank at his fortress, collecting a significant bounty of unmarked credits from the client. It wasn't until after Ventress departed once more aboard the subtram that Blank opened his prize to find Fett in the place of Sodi. Meanwhile, Ventress ransomed Pluma back to Krismo Sodi and the Kage for an additional sum of credits before returning to the skyhook turbolifts to meet the remaining members of the bounty hunter team in the space station above. Ventress subtracted her share from Blank's bounty payment and returned the rest—including Fett's money—to Bossk. Although the hunters commended her work for the team, Ventress insisted that she wasn't part of their syndicate, as she now had a new life to lead on her own.
<p>As the war raged in the rest of the galaxy, Ventress followed her new career as a bounty hunter and eventually began work out of a residence on Level 1312 in the seedy lower levels of Coruscant, the capital of the Galactic Republic in the Core Worlds. During this time, Ventress also acquired a new lightsaber with a yellow blade on the black market to replace her twin red sabers stolen by Offee. Her reputation as a successful hunter grew in the following months, garnering her the moniker "the Bald Banshee" and the ire of other bounty hunters—particularly Boba Fett. She also became familiar with a growing roster of underworld figures, including the Pyke Syndicate majordomo Fife.
<p>For one of her jobs, Asajj Ventress was hired by Lacezzi Macran, one of Coruscant's Level 1313's primary crime lords, to investigate a string of disappearances before the authorities started to investigate. During her investigation, she found some spores on the ground. However, some vermin attacked her. She fought off most of the vermin, but the mother was eaten by a tentacled creature in the shadows. She attacked but was sprayed with the same spores she found on the ground, which burned her. She then sliced several tentacles off the creature; however, she was shot in the back and went unconscious. When she awoke she found out that Meysor, Lacezzi Macran's adopted son, was taking care of a sarlacc, who was the creature in question. She released the sarlacc, which proceeded to eat Meysor. She found out that the sarlacc was replicating itself all across the city, which explained the spores, and also why the disappearances were so widespread. She lured all of the sarlaccs into her ship, flew into the sky, jumped out, and detonated it, killing all of the sarlaccs. But when she went to collect her payment from Lacezzi, he refused to pay her due to his son's death. Asajj then revealed that one of the sarlaccs had not boarded her ship. The sarlacc then ate Lacezzi, as Ventress walked away.
<p>She remained successful and shrewd in business and performed her work in a helmet with a retractable faceplate that obscured her identity. Not long after the Onderonian Civil War, Ventress delivered a near-dead Kalleran to her Devaronian bounty broker. While awaiting her payment, she saw and immediately accepted a bounty posted by the Galactic Senate for Ahsoka Tano, wanted for terrorism and crimes against the Republic for the bombing of the Jedi Temple and the murder of multiple clone troopers. Although she initially did not believe that the young Padawan was capable of such offenses, she took the job anyway and hunted the Jedi, who was on the run from both the Order and the Grand Army of the Republic. While hunting the fugitive Padawan, Ventress happened upon a Weequay thug assaulting a pair of Zygerrian sisters for their food. Ventress stepped in and quickly defeated the thug, severing his left arm in the process. As she departed, she bequeathed the Weequay's abandoned vibro-knife to the sisters. She eventually tracked Tano to Level 1313 of the undercity and followed her for a time until the young Togruta was alone in an alley. Ventress leaped from scaffolding above and tackled Tano, pinning her to the ground with her two sabers scissored over the Padawan's neck. After revealing her identity, Tano assumed it was Ventress who framed her for the crimes she was accused of committing, but the Dathomirian had no familiarity with the charges—she only intended to find Tano to collect the Senate's bounty.
<p>Ventress took custody of Tano and escorted her towards the landing platform at Terminal 24 of the undercity transportation hub, but the young Jedi still tried to reason with her, insisting that a Separatist war criminal and Sith could not simply hand her over to the Jedi Council without retribution. Although Ventress had intended to hand her over to a bondsman to collect her bounty, she sympathized with Tano's position as a student abandoned and betrayed by her masters. Ventress was still hesitant, but agreed to aid Tano in her quest for justice provided the Padawan advocate for her pardoning to the Council and Galactic Senate. As the two agreed to a deal, a team of clone troopers led by Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Master Plo Koon descended on them to capture Tano. Ventress led the young Togruta to safety, sealing them behind a ray shield that prevented Republic pursuit. Before they escaped, Skywalker caught a glimpse of his apprentice with Ventress, leading him to believe that the bounty hunter was involved with the bombing and Tano's framing.
<p>Although still wary of their deal and planning to turn Tano in if it proved more profitable to do so, Ventress led the wayward Padawan to her hideout on Level 1312. There, the Togruta rewired a holobooth to contact her friend, Jedi Padawan Barriss Offee, without being traced by the authorities. Unbeknownst to both women, a Republic probe droid had followed them there and relayed their location to a search party led by Clone Commander CC-3636—a clone whom Ventress had disfigured years earlier. Tano ended her conversation and informed Ventress that proof of her innocence may be found in an abandoned munitions warehouse on Level 1315. Ventress was familiar with the location and agreed to take the Padawan there, but the two were interrupted by CC-3636's team of clones. Wolffe attempted to take Tano into custody, but Ventress and the Togruta engaged the soldiers and disarmed or disabled all of them; Ventress specifically refrained from killing any of the clones for Tano's benefit and to prove that she had moved into a new phase of her life. Afterwards, she led her new ally to the munitions warehouse on Level 1315 and claimed that she had fulfilled her half of the bargain. She returned Tano's lightsaber to her and departed, reminding the Jedi that she was to advocate for her pardoning to the Republic.
<p>Ventress returned to her hideout on Level 1312, but sensed some continuing danger on her walk home. She was briefly distracted by a tooka cat, during which time she was ambushed by Barriss Offee, who hurled a metal barrel at Ventress's head, knocking her to the ground and removing her helmet. Ventress attempted to recover, but Offee approached her and hit her in the head with a metal pipe, knocking the bounty hunter unconscious. The renegade Jedi—responsible for the bombing of the Temple and murder of the clones—intended to frame both Tano and Ventress for her crimes and so stole the Dathomirian's lightsabers and helmet. Ventress recovered from the attack, but Offee adopted the bounty hunter's identity and attacked Tano in the warehouse. The deception led the Padawan to believe that Ventress had betrayed her and allowed the Jedi and clones to find Tano in the munitions warehouse filled with the same explosives that had been used to attack the Temple.
<p>Ventress went back into hiding in the undercity following the attack while Tano was taken into custody and expelled from the Jedi Order. The Togruta argued that it was likely Ventress who was behind the terrorism and framing plots, but with no evidence to support the claims, the Senate and Republic military insisted that Tano be indicted for the crimes. As the disgraced Padawan faced a military tribunal, Skywalker committed himself to ascertaining the validity of his apprentice's defense and so traveled to the undercity to hunt down Ventress. The bounty hunter sensed the Jedi stalking her while she walked through a slum, but was still unarmed after losing her lightsabers to Offee. The two fought briefly, but Ventress was quickly overpowered by the Jedi, who was enraged by the situation and brushing with the dark side. Skywalker seized Ventress in a Force choke before wrapping his own hand around her neck, nearly throttling her to death while accusing the bounty hunter of setting up Tano. When Ventress explained that she had only become involved for the sake of the Togruta's bounty, but ultimately sympathized with the spurned student, Skywalker released her. She explained to the Jedi that she had been attacked after leaving Tano at the warehouse but failed to identify her assailant—she could only confirm that the culprit had taken her lightsabers. She also confirmed that Tano had only spoken to one other individual after her escape from prison: Barriss Offee, the Jedi that led the two of them to the munitions warehouse.
<p>Skywalker believed Ventress's claims and returned to the Jedi Temple, where he confronted Offee and exposed her guilt. Offee admitted her crimes before the military tribunal and thereby cleared both Tano and Ventress of the accusations. Although Tano was offered the chance to return to the Jedi following her acquittal, she rejected the offer and left the Order, never having the opportunity to advocate for Ventress's pardoning to either the Council or the Senate.

<center><h3>a return to the dark side</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>For reasons unknown, Ventress had returned to the service of Count Dooku and the Separatist movement. Under Dooku's orders, Ventress executed most of the Sun Guard when Darth Sidious saw their destiny as complete. Some who survived served as Sidious' new Royal Guard in the new regime; others, who were Force-sensitive, became his Shadow Guard.
<p>Ventress had been sent to the planet Boz Pity, where she was placed in a bacta tank by Count Dooku and given cybernetic modifications to amplify her rage.
<p>When Republic forces attacked Boz Pity, Kenobi came upon the chamber in which Ventress was contained within a Separatist facility, and was subsequently attacked by her when she detected him in her trance. She fought against both Kenobi and Skywalker, only to be unexpectedly abandoned by Dooku, who did not want her to delay his escape with an exhausted and malfunctioned Grievous. He ordered an IG-100 MagnaGuard to kill her as she desperately tried to reach Dooku's shuttle. Using a blaster rifle, the droid shot Ventress down as she approached the shuttle.
<p>Enraged and wounded, Ventress attempted to kill Kenobi, who was trying to help her, only to be dealt a mortal wound by Anakin. As she lay dying, Ventress told Kenobi to protect the Galactic Core from Dooku, and finally let go of her anger and rage. Perhaps, she mused, Kenobi had been right about her. With that, Ventress appeared to die, and Obi-Wan ordered her apparent corpse to be placed aboard a medical shuttle.
<p>Despite appearances to the contrary, Ventress did not die, instead placing herself in a Sith trance on Boz Pity using her Sith healing techniques to heal the wounds she suffered. She was loaded aboard the med runner Bright Flight, and, while on board, emerged from her trance and ordered the pilots to alter their course; to take her as far away as possible from the war, Dooku, and the Jedi. The pilots complied.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>legacy</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Soon after her disappearance, Ventress was rumored to have fought in the Second Battle of Xagobah. Anakin Skywalker and Boba Fett engaged in a dogfight with the Ginivex-class starfighter similar to one used by Ventress over Xagobah. The pilot fighting on the Confederacy was buying time for the Techno Union Foreman Wat Tambor to escape.
<p>In 16 BBY, Obi-Wan Kenobi wrote in his journal that he was reminded of Ventress by a desert plant during his exile on Tatooine. He then planted seeds in memory of her.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>personality &amp; traits</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>As a child, Asajj Ventress was likely a very caring, compassionate individual. While during her apprenticeship under Ky Narec, he died which caused her to spiral into darkness. Consumed by grief, Ventress gave into her rage and lust for vengeance. She abandoned Jedi philosophy and pursued power and retribution, becoming a vicious warlord. Taking over Rattatak in a flurry of bloodshed and left with no further enemies to slake her bloodlust, Ventress focused her hatred outward. She came to blame the Jedi obsessively for, from her point of view, abandoning her master.
<p>Recruited by Dooku, Ventress became a Sith aspirant and embarked on a vicious killing spree against the Jedi as a Separatist commander during the Clone Wars. However, her general obsession over the Jedi eventually developed into a specific obsession over Obi-Wan Kenobi. It is unknown why she focused on Kenobi to the point of monomania, but his frequent escapes from death at her hands likely had something to do with it. Interestingly enough, their banter during battle occasionally had a pseudo-romantic theme, with Kenobi frequently referring to her as either "my sweet" or "my darling."
<p>Despite the number of Jedi Ventress slew, she remained angry and pained, coming to resent Dooku for not allowing her to join the Sith.
<p>Ventress took a great deal of pride in her own abilities and accomplishments, often viciously punishing whomsoever understated or criticized them, with examples including the unfortunate Captain Faro Argyus. She placed particular faith in her formidable lightsaber skills, and when these were described to her as those of an amateur by Luminara Unduli, Ventress' chagrin was immense.
<p>After being betrayed, abandoned and nearly killed by Dooku, Ventress wanted to kill him and went to the Nightsisters to find a way to kill her former Master. She recruited Savage Opress and treated him like a slave which ultimately caused him to turn against her. Ventress later became a bounty hunter but instead of becoming even harder, her exposure to the pain and suffering in the galaxy actually softened her. This caused her to save the life of Obi-Wan Kenobi and ally herself with Ahsoka Tano, both of whom she had previously tried to kill on several occasions. She also incapacitated a group of clones without killing any of them. She stated that not killing people was "the new me".
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>powers &amp; abilities</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Asajj Ventress was a master of Jar'Kai and took up the style after the death of her master, Ky Narec, taking up his lightsaber alongside her own. However, without Narec's guidance, she spiraled down the path of the dark side, and this showed in her bladework, which became furiously aggressive. She demonstrated her skills to Count Dooku during his visit to Rattatak, viciously killing off the competitors in the Cauldron in a furious display of bladework and raw power in the Force. During her subsequent duel with the Count, she fell on him in a blind fury, but was nonetheless defeated. However, she did impress the Count and his Sith Master, Darth Sidious, with her skills. The Count awarded her with the twin curved-hilt lightsabers of his former student, Komari Vosa.
<p>Wielding these new lightsabers, Ventress developed her skills under Dooku's tutelage, applying her skills in dual-blade combat to Makashi, and began utilizing the paired function of the weapons, demonstrating impressive skill with the saberstaff, and occasionally joined the weapons together with a fibercord, flailing them about. Eventually, her prowess as a duelist allowed her to hold her own against up to three adversaries with little difficulty, as she demonstrated during her mission to Ruul. Ventress' skills even advanced to the point where she was able to battle and defeat, or at least hold her own against, Jedi Council masters, an accomplishment that few of her contemporaries could match; she had disarmed Obi-Wan Kenobi during the initial stages of their duel on Teth, which seemed to impress the Jedi Master. While having lost to General Grievous in their first encounter, she was eventually able to contend with and defeat him at least twice.
<p>Despite her skills, Ventress was not without her weaknesses. During her earlier years, she lacked the major levels of physical strength to compensate for the inherent weaknesses of Jar'Kai and Makashi; her blows lacked power, as shown by Dooku's casual defensive moves during their bout on Rattatak; and she was left vulnerable to power attacks, as shown by her retreat before Anakin Skywalker's offensive frenzy during their duel on Yavin IV. However, she eventually developed the physical strength necessary to compensate for these weaknesses, demonstrating the ability to hold up simultaneous bladelocks with multiple duelists at a time. Even so, her technique still was not without its flaws; notably her usage of Makashi was criticized by Luminara Unduli as being "unrefined," "amateurish," and "sloppy." Ventress had also used to be heavily reliant on her second blade, and was left at a disadvantage if deprived of it. But later on in the Clone Wars, she overcame this weakness, having driven Plo Koon against the edge of a catwalk while one-handed.
<p>Ventress had been adept in the art of Dun Möch, taunting the Jedi on Ruul in the initial skirmish and eventually turning Rhad Tarn to the dark side. She had come close enough to obtaining the same result with Darrus Jeht, which was part of Dooku's plan from the beginning. On the Tranquility, she traded verbal jabs as well as saber strikes with Ahsoka Tano and Luminara Unduli. However, while fighting Anakin Skywalker on Coruscant, Ventress went too far in threatening the Jedi's secret wife, causing him to go even deeper in the dark side; she had nearly been killed as a result.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>force powers</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Though noted for her skill in physical combat, Ventress was said to have an unusual command of the Force. She may have been Darth Tyranus' most powerful Dark Acolyte, her connection to the Force second only to his. Obi-Wan Kenobi once stated that had Ventress not turned to the dark side, she could have been one of the greatest Jedi Masters in her era. Throughout the Clone Wars, Tyranus felt his apprentice growing stronger. Darth Sidious himself noted that Ventress was powerful; he knew that, once at her height, she and Tyranus could prove a combined threat and destroy him.
<p>Ventress was able to use telekinesis to a very high degree, as evidenced when she caused large sections of a roof to collapse during her initiation on Rattatak. In that same instance, she demonstrated a mastery of Force speed. She had displayed a great deal of aptitude with the Force Jump, performing it frequently during her fights.
<p>Ventress was able to use the iconic dark side power of Force Grip, as witnessed when she telekinetically lifted Captain Rex, while simultaneously choking him. Later, the Dark Jedi proved herself capable of Force choking and telekinetically levitating Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, both of whom were very powerful Jedi, at the same time; her aptitude had even increased to four targets, as shown by her killing of the pirates aboard the Raider. Ventress demonstrated an aptitude for using the Affect Mind ability, when she used the Force to make Rex do her bidding. She was able to easily command a Rancor in her and Tol Skorr's hunt for Obi-Wan Kenobi and Quinlan Vos, which would have been natural for a Nightsister. It is also possible that Ventress was capable of using the power Force Crush, as she attempted to use it to crush the heart of Jedi Master Fay during their confrontation. At one time, she telekinetically manipulated one of her lightsabers to stab the Jedi Tauht in the back.
<p>Before meeting Tyranus, Ventress had learned the ability to conceal her Force signature. While Tyranus may have sensed her as she killed his host upon her introduction, he was nonetheless impressed. Taking Ventress under his wing, he had taught her the more advanced Quy'Tek meditations to the point that, by 21 BBY, Obi-Wan Kenobi noted her perfection of the art. Ventress could not only to hide her presence within the close proximity of Jedi Council members, but also strike her blind target without being detected.
<p>It should also be noted that Ventress had at least some of the more esoteric Force powers at her command. She had learned what she would term as "lesser arts" of the Sith from Tyranus, "devices" and "little scraps" that came easily for her. She re-animated dead Gungans during the Battle of Ohma-D'un, which would come across as Tsaiwinokka Hoyakut, an ancient, elaborate form of Sith magic. Pyrokinesis was not unknown to Ventress, as she demonstrated on Yavin 4, commanding flames to sweep aside for her. She could even be creative with the Force: in her first duel with Tyranus, she somehow caused a column to collapse on him by crossing both her lightsabers just a few meters away, almost as if she were cutting it down.
<p>Ventress had learned at least one trick from the Nightsisters before she had met Tyranus: the blood trail. Using her own blood on her conquered enemies on Rattatak, she would be able to know where they went.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>other abilities</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>In addition to her lightsaber skills and Force powers, Ventress also proved to be an excellent pilot during the Battle of Muunilinst as she was able to shoot down numerous Republic starfighters within seconds and survive a dogfight with Anakin Skywalker, who was considered to be the greatest pilot in the Jedi Order.
<p>Ventress also displayed considerable skill in unarmed combat, notably being able to easily fight a group of Nightbrothers when she was looking for a suitable servant on Dathomir. Her hand-to-hand combat skills were later displayed when she fought Savage Opress and Darth Maul alongside Obi-Wan Kenobi, dodging Opress's aggressive blows and striking back with a flurry of punches and kicks until Kenobi returned her lightsaber to her.

Ventress's speed, power and agility were augmented and she was outfitted with dueling armor capable of deflecting lightsabers and blaster bolts. Asajj also added more tattoos to her face. Seeking revenge, Ventress then methodically took out all of Count Dooku's security systems and made her way into his inner sanctum to confront him in combat. Shrugging off or deflecting his Force lightning, she used her double-bladed lightsaber to tear through his defenses and put an end to him once and for all. Darth Sidious, pleased to have a younger, more powerful apprentice, knighted Ventress as Darth Vindicaa. Ventress was silently planning to eventually overthrow him as well.<br /><br />

<b>a fine justification</b> &mdash; <a href="/tagged/⸢ verse → ventress ⸥ ❛ v; a fine justification ❜ || the old guard">threads</a> alternate verse:   Hadriana was a name she knew once, before she’d been taken captive and thrown into the arena. Everyone knew about the gladiators. The Roman Empire had coliseums all over the empire to put on their games and to watch gladiators fight and kill one another. Not many knew about the gladiatrices. That had been her life; training and fighting in the hopes that one day she would gain her freedom. Unfortunately that day never came. It had been in the middle of one of the many games that the empire held when death finally came for her. She never thought she would come to life. Had it not been for Andromache she might’ve been buried alive with all the other bodies from those games. Instead, she travelled with the other, learning to fight and coming to terms with the fact she was now immortal. While she can fight she tends to stick to planning or helping those who joined them, helping them adjust to the fact they are now immortal.<br /><br />

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>overview</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Skywalker was born in the year 41 BBY before moving to the Outer Rim planet Tatooine during the Age of the Republic. Although he had a mother, the slave Shmi Skywalker, the truth about his parentage was that Anakin had no father—leading Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn to suspect that Skywalker's conception was the work of the midi-chlorians. Recognizing the boy's unprecedented connection to the Force, Jinn was determined to see Skywalker trained as a member of the Jedi Order, the task of which ultimately fell to his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi following Jinn's death by Darth Maul in 32 BBY.
<p>Over the next decade, Skywalker rose to become one of the strongest Jedi in galactic history. While he was both caring and compassionate, his fear of loss was ultimately the catalyst for his downfall. During the Clone Wars, Skywalker trained a Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, who ultimately left the Jedi Order after she was framed for the terrorist attack on the Jedi Temple. The loss of Tano affected Skywalker on a personal level, causing him to feel more isolated and bitter towards the Jedi High Council. With the Clone Wars nearing conclusion, Skywalker succumbed to the temptations of the dark side, believing the Sith had the power to save the life of Senator Padmé Amidala, his secret wife. Christened "Darth Vader" by his new Master Darth Sidious, the newly minted Sith Lord assaulted the Coruscant Jedi Temple, killing fully trained Jedi and novice younglings alike.
<p>After assassinating the leaders of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Vader was confronted on Mustafar by his one-time friend and mentor, Kenobi, resulting in a lightsaber duel that left Vader burned and mutilated. As a consequence of his defeat, he was rebuilt as a cyborg and encased in a life-sustaining suit of armor, further distancing the persona of Vader from that of Anakin Skywalker. In addition, Amidala's death in childbirth broke the fallen Jedi Knight's heart, leaving him more machine than man mentally as well as physically.

<br />

<center><h3>personality traits</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Anakin was known to be passionate, confident, and just a little cocky, traits that his soldiers admired, and his fellow Jedi scolded. He was also known to share a strong bond with Ahsoka, risking his own life and those of others to save her. Anakin also had very strong mutual affection for Senator Padmé Amidala, a relationship and marriage both had to hide from others. Anakin is a show off. He also has deep anger that makes him a victim of the dark side.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>lightsabre techniques</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Anakin was an adept of the advanced variant of Form V, Djem So. It was a very aggressive style, created from making Shien form specifically for lightsaber dueling. This suited Anakin's somewhat aggressive nature well. Anakin also had some skill in Form VI, Niman, a hybrid form made by adding all previous forms into a single, generalized form. This form made him adept at wielding dual lightsabers. This is combined with the Ataru gymnastic ability.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>force powers</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Blessed with impressive reflexes that were typical of a Jedi, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn saw enormous potential in the 9-year-old Skywalker and believed him to have been conceived by the Force itself. Indeed, when his blood was tested, Skywalker's midi-chlorian count was above 20,000, reportedly even greater than Yoda's. The total amount was, however, unknown, for the reading was off the scale.
<p>When he was nine, Anakin was already skilled in having quick reflexes and precognition. This was something he used to an advantage when he participated in pod racing. He was also able to sense what things were without looking at them.
<p>In his teen years, Skywalker's Force training progressed to the point where he was able to manifest various abilities, and Kenobi thought of him as being "advanced for his age." He was very skilled at using the Force to scan his surroundings, such as when he sensed poisonous kouhuns infiltrating Amidala's bedroom despite being in another room at the time. He was also skilled at sensing other people's feelings, and disturbances in the Force. Skywalker also showed aptitude for precognitive dreams, as when he foresaw the deaths of both his mother and his wife in dreams, but also of himself becoming a Jedi, back when he lived with his mother on Tatooine. However, Skywalker struggled in using the Force to control and befriend animals, noting that Kenobi was much better at it than he was.
<p>Skywalker was skilled in telekinesis: even as a late beginner, by his own admission, he was very good at it, better than any Padawan his age, and most of the older ones as well. He could lift lightsabers in the air and ignite them with ease, as he did once to scare a pair of Padawans who had called him a "slave to his emotions." Despite having an exceptionally strong connection to the Force, Skywalker tended not to use it very often during lightsaber duels and focused instead on the physical aspects of combat. This tendency held even when facing opponents who made liberal use of the Force during duels, such as Count Dooku.
<p>During the Clone Wars, Anakin's power and skill continued to increase. He became capable ot utilizing telekinesis to accomplish such esoteric tasks as creating air bubbles around another person's head to enable breathing underwater, as shown when he saved Padmé's life at Mon Cala. During his mission to Utapau, Anakin was able to feel brain waves on a dead body, and when he first met Grand Admiral Thrawn, he was able to feel his thoughts by reaching out to him through the Force. At one point during the war, the Chosen One was able to telekinetically subdue both the Son and the Daughter simultaneously. However, this empowerment was lost when the Dark side grew too powerful and disrupted the balance in the Force.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>other skills</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Even at a young age, Skywalker demonstrated a great aptitude for piloting, mechanics, and engineering—he rebuilt the protocol droid C-3PO, an advanced droid fluent in over six million forms of communication, as well as a functional podracer. Although during his adulthood he would rarely use his talent as a mechanic, he would remain skilled at repairing technology.
<p>As a pilot, Skywalker showed an amazing ability that few were able to surpass, and Kenobi would later describe him to his son Luke as "the best star pilot in the galaxy." Anakin was able to pilot a pod racer and was the first and only human thus far to compete in a pod race. He was also able to survive the Battle of Naboo and would go on to improve his skills in flying and aerial combat. Throughout the Clone Wars, Anakin was known for being the best pilot in the Republic and was known for leading the charge in battles and coming out alive. He was very skilled in chasing down targets, shaking off-target locks, and outmaneuvering many opponents. His strength in the Force also gave him quick reflexes, an ability that would help in dodging fire and focusing on enemy targets. He also displayed incredible precognition, as he was capable of predicting the movements of his targets during dogfights with pinpoint precision. He once managed to land the Invisible Hand when it was half-destroyed and breaking up in the atmosphere. Despite this, Skywalker would occasionally be shot down during his combat piloting career. However, this was a very rare sight and few could have the skills to do such a feat.
<p>Although he mainly used lightsabers, Skywalker was extremely proficient at the use of blaster pistols. He also had some training on the use of staves, a skill he once taught to a Felucian village so that they could defend themselves. Skywalker spoke Galactic Basic and Huttese, and understood the Bith language.

<center><h3>the file</h3></center>
<p>&#9642; <b>name:</b> Lanie Kara Blackstone
<p>&#9642; <b>age:</b> 31
<p>&#9642; <b>height:</b> 1.84m 
<p>&#9642; <b>hair colour:</b> dark brown almost black
<p>&#9642; <b>eye colour:</b> brown with hazel flecks
<p>&#9642; <b>sexual orientation:</b> heterosexual
<p>&#9642; <b>species:</b> pureblood witch
<p>&#9642; <b>nationality:</b> english
<p>&#9642; <b>occupation:</b> hit wizard with the department of magical law enforcement  
<p>&#9642; <b>additional information:</b> ferret patronus &amp; elder wood / dragon heartstring wand
<br />

<center><h3>the hit wizard</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Lanie’s story actually starts before she was born. It starts while her mother was married to a man she never knew; her biological father. Like most typical pureblood families, Kiara and Daegan were promised to each other after they graduated from Hogwarts. While not the “typical” married couple, for the first couple years of their marriage they were, for all intensive purposes, happy. Kiara went to begin her Healer training, and Daegan made an attempt at the family business. While the Blackstone’s had many businesses, Daegan was told to work in their magical antiquities shop that tended to carry items darker in nature.
<p>All seemed well until Daegan got bored, and decided to enjoy the bachelor life he never had, and could be seen on countless occasions on the arms of many different witches. As a faithful witch, and wife, Kiara silently stood by, deciding to spend as much time as possible at the hospital, instead of at home, knowing her husband had indulged in other women. This charade had gone on for a year, Daegan continuously photographed with high society witches, while Kiara worked. One night, Kiara came home early to find Daegan, in bed, with another witch, and obliviated them both.
<p>One month later, Kiara found herself pregnant, and left the wizarding world behind, deciding a life in the muggle world would be better than that she had been currently living. Kiara decided to keep her job as a healer, and it was during her lunch break at a nearby muggle café that she met Eli, her current husband. They fell in love and married seven months later, Eli not caring the child Kiara was carrying wouldn’t be his. When Lanie was born, she was given the Blackstone name, and formally adopted by Eli.
<p>Lanie lived what could be considered a “normal” life, knowing she could possibly be a witch. She did all the things normal muggle children did, and even made some friends. It wasn’t until after she received her letter to Hogwarts that she found out the man she had called dad all these years wasn’t really her father. It was quite the shock, and while she begged her mother for any and all information regarding her “other” father, Kiara all but refused. It had been eleven years, and Kiara wanted nothing more to do with the man she had called husband.
<p>Once she arrived at Hogwarts, Lanie tried her best to make friends, but found it hard with the information she had received from her mother still in the front of her thoughts. She put all her effort into her schoolwork, and any free time she had was spent in the library trying to find out exactly whom she could contact for information. Off the bat Lanie loved Charms, Transfiguration, and Potions, while absolutely disliking History of Magic.
</div>
<br/ >
<br />
<center><h3>life after hogwarts</h3></center>
<p>graduating as not only a prefect, but head girl, lanie had a myriad of choices when it came to her life post hogwarts. the department of mysteries came calling as well as the department of magical law enforcement. even though her mother was a healer, she never saw herself following that path. instead, she joined the ministry and started work in the law enforcement patrol. in time she worked her way up to the hit wizard division, where she currently works. there are times when she works with those in the auror division due to her skill set, but for the most part she prefers to keep to the hit wizard division.
<p>she currently owns a tri-level row house in notting hill, as well as a flat in sydney harbour. while her row house is situated in a muggle section of town, she's taken great care to have wards in place to keep them at bay. though, lanie has made exceptions for her neighbours and family just in case someone needs to get ahold of her. her sydney property only has one way in and out of; via portkey. and she's the only one who has it. it's also the only property with house elves, as she's taken precautions for them not to be seen by muggles.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>general appearance</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Lanie had always been tall for her age, and upon first glance, one would notice the young girl as being quite lanky, with most of her height coming from her long legs. At eleven years of age she already stood at five foot two inches tall, and according to her mother, would end up even taller by the time she was done growing. She may look like a pushover, but she is far from it, having grown up with a brother six years her senior. Her arms, while not well defined, have muscle tone to them, and the same goes for her legs, as her older brother was also into football. Looks can be deceiving, because if necessary, she can definitely stand up for herself in a fight.
<p>Her oval face is normally framed by her almost raven locks, which are sometimes kept tucked behind her ears. Her dark hair and eyes tend to stand out more against her complexion, which not olive in colour, but not pale, sickly white either. Her complexion could be considered medium, as she does enjoy spending time outside, and does tan up to a point. From far away, one would assume Lanie had a clear complexion, but upon closer inspection she has a speckling of very faint freckles across her face, arms, and shoulders.
<p>Lanie would definitely not call herself cute, but from afar one could get that impression with her pouty lips, and cute as a button nose. She’s definitely not your typical girl, and would call herself a tomboy instead.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>dressing style</h3></center>
<p>Even though Lanie is a pureblood, she would prefer muggle clothing, like jeans and t-shirts to dress robes. When not in school, she can always be found in plain coloured t-shirts in a variety of colours, such as red, blue, green, or purple, paired with blue jeans, and combat boots.
<p>When it comes to jewellery, Lanie prefers to wear nothing but a simple watch on her left wrist. Anything else she considers too girly, and something she would never find herself wearing.
<p>She does not consider herself a slob, and tends to take pride in her appearance, making sure her clothes are wrinkle-free and her hair has had a brush run through it. The tomboy in her prefers things simplistic, and comfortable. If it is not comfortable she will not wear it.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>likes</h3></center>
<p>Lanie enjoys spending time alone, studying, or practicing the fine art of potion making. With her mother being a healer, her summers are spent learning to make potions, starting from the very simplistic with eventual goals of making the more complex ones. Lanie also enjoys learning charms or hexes, and looks forward to the day she can spend time in a proper dueling arena.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>dislikes</h3></center>
<p>Lanie dislikes those who play games and waste her time. She is an upfront and honest person, and prefers others to be more like her. She also dislikes those who don’t understand the concept of being on time. If she has to make the effort, than so does everyone else.
<p>When it comes to class work, she dislikes helping people unless she has something to gain from it. As for specific classes, she dislikes sitting through HoM, or Herbology, as they are boring, and she sees no use to them. She also dislikes flying as she is afraid of heights, though with the right person could be persuaded to fly.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>general personality</h3></center>
<p>Unlike most girls of her age, Lanie is not a bright ray of sunshine. She is a quiet girl, bordering on shy, but will voice her opinion at the opportune time. Her sarcasm tends to make her come off cold and uncaring; something for the most part that is true to her nature. For those that are patient, or stubborn enough to break through the façade she has created for herself, they will find that she is a caring person, and willing to do almost anything for them. Trust is something earned, not given, and with Lanie it takes a lot for her to give someone her trust.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>strengths</h3></center>
<p>Fortunately, or unfortunately, Lanie is loyal to a fault. She isn’t quite sure if that is a strength or a weakness at this point in time, but for now considers it a strength. When it comes to her friends she will defend them to the end. Lanie is also quite honest, to the point of being brutal about it. While many may find that a weakness, Lanie feels it is the only way to live, and expects the same from those whom she considers friends.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>weaknesses</h3></center>
<p>One of Lanie’s major weaknesses is her quick temper. She has been known to lose it at the drop of a hat over the most miniscule things. She is also quite stubborn, and refuses to give up even if she knows she’s wrong. And along those lines, she refuses to believe she is ever wrong. If proven to be so, she will find a way to prove herself right again. Being quite headstrong, she tends to charge in first, ask questions later. Even though she grew up with an older brother, the concept of friends is something she has yet to grasp, only having a few acquaintances.

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>early years // book &amp; show canon</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Magnus was born to a half-Dutch and half-Indonesian woman and the Prince of Hell Asmodeus in the 17th century in Jakarta, Indonesia, back then known as Batavia of the Dutch East Indies. He was born seemingly normal, only with unusual amber eyes. 
<p>When Magnus was nine years old, his mother realized that his cat eyes were a sign that he was part demon. She could not handle the fact that she bore the son of a demon, so she committed suicide. Magnus found his mother's lifeless body in her bed moments before his step-father did. His step-father called him an abomination and blamed him for his mother's death. Magnus then killed him by burning him with his magic. 
<p>He was then brought up by churchmen and raised by the Silent Brothers of Madrid, Spain, in the 17th century. He received the name "Magnus Bane" from them. It was in Spain where Magnus later met and saved Catarina Loss from being burned as a witch, who later became his lifelong, fellow immortal friend. 
<p>Being a very skilled and powerful warlock, Magnus began charging for his services fairly young, even before he was a full-grown warlock. Though he was only less than twenty years old, he had already begun lying about his age, claiming to be hundreds of years old, old enough to know historical figures such as Julius Caesar and certain oracles, to increase his clients' confidence in him.
<p>At one point, Magnus fell in love with someone and had, for the first time in his long life, stayed with his lover for the duration of the girl's mundane life. Even for thirty years after that, Magnus still has not moved on from the pain, though it had become tolerable, and was still on an extended vacation, seeking adventure in places like Peru, unable to settle somewhere with the thought of his late lover still stinging. Magnus once cited this heartbreak about a century after to another warlock friend who had lost her first loved one, saying that the first one was always the hardest.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>new york // book &amp; show canon</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>In 1929, Magnus was running a speakeasy, Mr. Dry's, during the Prohibition era. The mundane world was heavily influenced by the economy and financial problems.
<p>By October 1929, after all those long alcohol parties and hangovers, he finally noticed the mundane financial crisis, after saving one of his fellow drink buddies, Alfie, from a suicide jump out of the window. Apparently, at the same time, in the Hotel Dumort, Aldous Nix opened the door to the Pandemonium, which in turn swallowed him up and did not miss conjuring up half of the hotel along with the warlock. Closing the Portal took a major amount of Magnus's energy and a bit of his blood.
<p>In 1977, Magnus finally returned to New York from a trip that he intended to only run for a week but instead kept getting extended until he was away from home for two years. Shortly after arriving, Magnus immediately realized that the city had changed for the worse. He also discovered that Camille and her vampires, while doped up on drugged humans, had begun uncontrollably feeding on and killing mundanes. Though he managed to help the New York werewolf pack solve the problem, Magnus found the disturbing circumstances of his most recent encounter with Camille too painful. He later contacted Catarina and had her perform memory spells on him to make him forget all his encounters with Camille in the twentieth century.
<p>After years of partying in the 1970s, Magnus decided to pick up an introverted hobby. He briefly collected stamps but grew tired of the sorting and moved on to growing Bonsai trees, but found that it was pointless as he could just use magic to grow the plants. He went on to start a livelier hobby: throwing elaborate theme parties, which suited him better
<p>In 1989, giving the news Magnus had heard of what the Circle had been doing to Downworlders, he was having doubts about whether staying in New York, or finding a place where he would be safe. One night, a werewolf boy came to ask for his help, telling Magnus that his family had been captured by Valentine Morgenstern and his followers. Magnus then warned the Withelaws, who were at the New York Institute, that the Circle was in town violating the Accords. When Magnus confronted Valentine, he was making a little werewolf girl blind by putting silver coins over her eyes. Magnus fought Valentine until Lucian Graymark appeared, making Valentine and the rest of the Circle leave. When the fight was over, Magnus realized that he couldn't run away from the Circle, and decided to permanently stay in New York, becoming the High Warlock of Brooklyn. 
<p>Two years after the Uprising in 1993, Tessa was staying with Magnus in New York when Jocelyn Fairchild came to ask him to protect her daughter, Clary. In the beginning, Magnus treated her skeptically as he knew that she was a part of the Circle. However, after Jocelyn told them about her escape and that her daughter was in need of help, Tessa encouraged Magnus to listen to her. As a result, Tessa, in the place of an Iron Sister, then performed the Shadowhunter children's ritual on Clary with Brother Zachariah.
<p>Eventually, he was hired by Jocelyn, to erase Clary's memories of seeing anything related to the Shadowhunter World. She initially wished to remove Clary's inner eye, which was providing her sight of Shadowhunter world, however, Magnus warned that this would likely kill Clary or in the least drive her to pure insanity. Instead, he cast a spell on her that would cause her to forget anything she saw that was related to the Shadowhunter World. But this spell would fade as time passed, needing to be recast every two years. 
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>relationships &amp; alec lightwood</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Camille and Magnus have known each other in as early as the 1850s. Magnus loved and cared for her, and though she returned his affection and even helped him through a rough patch, there came a time when Camille cheated on him with a mundane. She had begun to view love as fleeting for them immortals, no longer interested in finding true love
<p>Magnus met Camille at a meeting between Downworlders and Shadowhunters, taking place at the London Institute. He is initially attracted to her and though he thinks of the ways to see her again, he prompts her to give Ralf Scott, a young werewolf, another chance at her love and promises to return back to her one day. Magnus gives her a ruby necklace to remember him by and they part after sharing a kiss.
<p>However, they break up after Magnus discovers that Camille has gone to St. Petersburg to be with a human lover. Despite what happened, however, Magnus still cared for her enough to help her and her clan quit their addiction to drugs. 
<p>Alec is the love of Magnus's life. 
<p>At a party, magnus talked about his tragic past, and Alec Lightwood sympathized with him and tried to remove the morbid atmosphere, but Magnus brushed it off, claiming that it happened a long time ago. He openly flirted with Alec by asking him to call him and winking at him. Alec, however, who had yet to 'come out of the closet', thought he was in love with Jace Wayland, his adopted brother. 
<p>Magnus was later called upon by the Lightwoods to heal Alec, who had been fatally wounded while fighting the Greater Demon Abbadon. Isabelle said that when Magnus showed up he was quite in a rushed hurry to get Alec to a private room in order to heal him.
<p>Magnus continued to work on his new relationship with Alec. Realizing that they had yet to go on their first date because of their constantly busy lives, Magnus sent him a fire message claiming to have an emergency. He told Alec that they should go on their first date, insisting that making time for things he cares about will remind him of what he was fighting for in times of war and conflict. Alec agreed and the two went to the Hunter's Moon. 
<p>Their night began smoothly, with Magnus ordering them drinks and the two of them getting competitive playing pool. However, things soon took a turn. Magnus discovered that Alec had never been in a relationship before, which Alec was reluctant to admit as he did not want Magnus to treat him differently due to his lack of experience. Magnus was taken aback to hear Alec had been with no one else before. He then became nervous when Alec asked how many people he had been with, before finally letting Alec guess he had been with 17,000 people. 
<p>Self-conscious, Alec grew quiet and thoughtful, thinking all the way back to Magnus' loft after their date. Alec then expressed doubt about their relationship, wondering if they were too different to really make it work. Just as Alec was beginning to leave, he stopped and reconsidered, telling Magnus he didn't care how many people he had been with. Magnus returned the sentiment, stating he didn't care how many people Alec hadn't been with. Alec kissed Magnus and the two decide they want to put in effort for their relationship to be a good one.
<p>Their first date was followed by many others, including trips to other parts of the world like Tokyo and Prague through Portal. From one of their trips, Alec bought Magnus an omamori charm, meant to protect the wearer and bring them luck. Magnus later opened up to Maia Roberts, a friend bartender at the Hunter's Moon, that it had been a long time since someone had given him a gift and he believed Alec was someone special.
<p>Despite his long list of lovers and past relationships, Magnus felt vulnerable in his relationship with Alec. While Alec wanted to take the next step in their relationship, Magnus feared that if they moved too quickly, he would lose him. Alec reassured him that he did not have to worry about that, and the two slept together for the first time. During this intimate moment, Magnus lost control over his glamour and moved away, feeling self-conscious about his exposed warlock mark: his cat eyes. Magnus was afraid of Alec's reaction, but he reacted well, touching Magnus' face and telling him they were beautiful, that he was beautiful.

<br />

<center><h3>personality</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Magnus is fierce, intelligent, cunning, and wise. He is caring and deeply compassionate, understanding people's motivations with ease due to the experiences he's lived through over hundreds of years.
<p>He is incredibly protective of his people, considering his role as their leader seriously and taking responsibility for the safety of all warlocks. This takes priority over his own happiness. He is often distrusting of Shadowhunters because of the Downworlders' history with them and their constant mistreatment of Magnus and his kind. Despite this, he is not past being friendly with Shadowhunters, especially those who do not mean them harm. 
<p>This protective instinct is not limited to warlocks only, as he has also helped many new Downworlders navigate through the Downworld. He made a promise to himself after having to learn everything about the Downworld on his own and has since harbored, protected, and guided other Downworlders. He considers all the Downworlders he's helped as his children, something that means a lot to him since warlocks cannot bear children of their own. 
<p>Magnus has difficulty leaving people who need help and guidance to fend for themselves, though he would sometimes request heavy payment from those affiliated with the Clave and their ideals, or complain as he lends people a hand. He also has a deep sense of gratitude towards those who help him and his people. 
<p>Aside from his power and skill, he is also known for his eccentric style and his exquisite tastes. Magnus can be sarcastic and never hesitates to snap a witty retort when annoyed or hurt. As much as he may appear aloof and uncaring at times, it hides how lonely his life has been and how vulnerable he can be. 
<p>As a warlock employed for his services or help, Magnus is incredibly reliable, able to come up with magical solutions for most problems. Despite usually requiring hefty payments, he has helped others countless of times free of charge, particularly during his tenure as High Warlock.
<p>Magnus is <b>openly bisexual</b>, having been with many men and women, nor does he discriminate between kinds as he has dated mundanes, Downworlders, and, most recently, a Shadowhunter. After Camille broke his heart, he closed himself off to feeling love for anyone else. That changed briefly with his friend Dot, and again when he met Alec Lightwood. 
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>skills &amp; abilities</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p><b>Immortality:</b> As a warlock, Magnus has been granted immortality. Physically, Magnus does not age and has maintained the appearance of a young man for centuries. 
<p><b>Magic:</b> Magnus has access to magical powers that often manifest themselves as flames or smoky sparks at his fingertips. Magnus is capable of casting spells, performing summoning rituals, healing, and memory magic. His magic often appears blue but also appears in different colors, depending on the type of magic and intent with which he is using it.

<center><h3>early years</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Lucie developed a love for writing when she was young. On her eighth birthday, James got her a thick blank book, which became one of her most prized possessions. She kept it next to her bed and copied her favorite pieces of her own work into it.
<p>During a trip to France with her mother, Lucie met and, in a span of two weeks, became very close to Cordelia Carstairs. They began to exchange letters every week In 1897, Lucie asked Cordelia to be parabatai and she agreed; though the ceremony was put off as the Clave wanted to make sure they were grown enough to decide. At the age of twelve, Lucie began to write a novel called The Beautiful Cordelia for her and sent her new chapters every month for four years.
<p>As of 1901, Lucie and her mother were teaching themselves Persian, with the occasional help from Thomas Lightwood, because Lucie felt she should be able to speak the same languages as her future parabatai.

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>early life</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Theresa Gray was born to an unmarked Shadowhunter named Elizabeth Gray and the Greater Demon, Belial, disguised as the mundane Richard Gray—Elizabeth's husband and the man who would raise her as his own, and whom everyone believed was her father. Under normal circumstances, children of Shadowhunters and demons would be stillborn, but Elizabeth was able to give birth to Tessa not only because she bore no runes, but also because she wore the clockwork angel.
<p>For much of her early life, she was unaware of what she truly was and her true parentage. Conceived in London, Tessa's family moved to New York while Elizabeth was pregnant with her. After the death of her parents in a carriage accident when she was only three years old, she and her brother, Nate, were raised by her maternal aunt, Harriet Moore. She spent the majority of her life being overprotected by her Aunt Harriet and looking after Nate, who grew up spoiled. Tessa grew up taking comfort in books, dreaming of having the kind of adventures she read about. At sixteen, her Aunt Harriet died of what she thought was a fever. Upon her death, Nate arranged for Tessa to move to London with him.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>life in london</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Tessa traveled from New York to London when Nate called for her, shortly after the death of their Aunt Harriet. Once there, a pair of mysterious and sinister women, whom she called the Dark Sisters, gave her a letter written in Nate's handwriting and told her that they've come to collect her on Nate's behalf.
<p>The Dark Sisters soon revealed that they apparently had Nate as a prisoner, showing her their father's ring, one that Nate always wore, splattered with blood. They forced her to Change, or shape-shift, torturing her to learn quickly as well as threatening to harm Nate if she did not do as they asked. The Dark Sisters had made a deal with "the Magister" who had hoped to marry her and exploit her ability. In her isolation, she wrote letters to Nate about her loneliness and imprisonment.
<p>One day, after Changing into Emma Bayliss, she was told about her marriage arrangement with the Magister, who had long been waiting for her. After a futile attempt of escape, she was finally rescued by the Shadowhunter Will Herondale. Tessa passed out in the midst of the fight against the Dark Sisters and was taken to the London Institute.
<p>During her stay at the Institute, the head Charlotte Branwell promised to take care of her and help her search for Nate. There, Tessa befriended Jem Carstairs and the rest of the Institute's residents and staff, particularly Sophie Collins, the handmaid, while she had an uneasy relationship with Jessamine Lovelace, who wanted to move out of the Institute with Tessa.
<p>When the investigation for her brother led them to Alexei de Quincey's house, she took the form of the vampire Camille Belcourt to infiltrate an exclusive party, with Will posing as her human subjugate and Magnus Bane, Camille's lover, as her guide. Once the human captive at the party was bitten, Will sent a signal to the Nephilim lying in wait to attack. Tessa then realized that the captive human was her brother, Nate.
<p>During the battle, de Quincey went after Tessa, who was still in the form of Camille. Will, to save Tessa, fought him and ended up biting the vampire. After the battle, Nate was brought back to the Institute, where he was questioned and allowed to recover. Tessa got only a few moments with Nate since Jessamine, who wanted to marry a mundane so she can leave the Shadowhunter world, seemed insistent on caring for him instead, hoping Nate would fall in love with her.
<p>Later, Tessa learned from Sophie that Will was being difficult about his treatment, which involved drinking buckets of holy water to bring up the vampire blood he had ingested, or else he would become a darkling. Tessa volunteered to take it to him in the attic, and Will finally obliged. During their rather intimate conversation, they shared their first kiss, before Will pushed her away and insisted that she leave him. After this evening, Will became even more standoffish and unfriendly towards her, much to Tessa's confusion.
<p>To her surprise the following day, the Shadowhunters were discussing the further interrogation of Nate, possibly by the Silent Brothers. Annoyed, Tessa made it clear that their goals are not her responsibility, and that she did her part as they searched for Nate. Before leaving, she called them out for their pretentious attitude towards Downworlders and mundanes. After having some time to feel sorry about shouting at them, particularly since she was primarily only mad at Will, she left the Institute. She was promptly followed by Jem, who then began pointing out some places in London that might help her learn to love the city and even took her to his favorite—the Blackfriars Bridge. Here, Jem told her bits of his and Will's story and told her that he thinks she is no less human than him.
<p>Unbeknownst to them, they were followed by a pair of automatons, one of them the being the clockwork coachman of the Dark Sisters, under the Magister's orders. Jem briefly engaged them before running off with Tessa and got as far as the Institute before Jem collapsed, his illness striking at a bad time; fortunately, Charlotte immediately came to their rescue. During Jem's recovery, he told her about his illness, his body's dependence on yin fen, so she wouldn't blame herself.
<p>When Nate woke up, he quickly devised a plan that he secretly told the Magister of but continued to bear the semblance of a frightened boy who wanted nothing more than to go home with Tessa and live a normal life. Selling her and the others lies and some half-truths about the true nature of his business in London, Nate falsely told them that de Quincey was the Magister and that the Dark Sisters would perform the binding ritual, a spell that would improve the automatons, that Magnus Bane had previously told them about on a full moon, the next of which was that very evening.
<p>Nate's claim forced the Enclave to act immediately, leaving Tessa at the Institute with the non-Shadowhunters and the young ones, Jessamine, Will, and Jem. The mundane previously interrogated by Charlotte named Axel Mortmain then arrived and fed them false information about de Quincey and the Dark Sisters, telling Jem and Will where they were, prompting the pair to respond and leave. With the Institute now vulnerable, Mortmain revealed himself as the true Magister and attacked the Institute with his automaton army, intent on taking Tessa. Nate's connection to the Magister was also revealed.
<p>When confronted by Mortmain, Tessa recalled Will's words to her earlier, explaining that the British warrior-queen Boadicea was braver than any man because she killed herself rather than let herself be taken by the Romans. With this inspiration, she prepared to kill herself to escape Mortmain. However, she realized that if she Changed into the form of a dead woman, particularly Adams, whose form she had already taken while under the tutelage of the Dark Sisters, she would bleed convincingly. By Changing very quickly, and for a very short time, into a woman who had been shot, she convinced Mortmain that she was dead and he left when confronted by Will.
<p>Will was momentarily affectionate, but then put an even greater distance between them. Later, she confronted Will, hoping to reconcile, but he was unkind, treating her like a prostitute and revealed that she was unable to have children as she was a warlock. Tessa left, hurt and confused.
<p>Over the next couple of weeks, Tessa grew closer to Jem, who volunteered to keep touring Tessa around London.
<p>Tessa was present, and was a key witness, at the trial of Charlotte Branwell in front of the Clave, about the attack on the London Institute. Charlotte was given two weeks to find Mortmain or she would have had to resign as head of the Institute, and be replaced by Benedict Lightwood.
<p>Tessa, accompanied Will and Jem, up to the York Institute to meet Aloysius Starkweather, who may hold a clue to the Magister's past. Jem gave her the Carstairs family ring, so that she could pretend to be a mundane girl who was engaged to Jem and was set for Ascension.
<p>Tessa was trained by Gabriel Lightwood to defend herself, in case there was an attack against the London Institute.
<p>Sophie Collins came to Tessa with an invitation to a masked ball at the Lightwood's house, addressed to Jessamine from Nate. Jessamine slapped Sophie when she saw Sophie with it, so Sophie hit and knocked her out. Tessa sent Sophie to Will for help, and he placed a sleeping rune on Jessamine so that she would not wake up until morning, and tied her to her bed as a precaution. Tessa Changed into Jessamine, and Will accompanied her, so that she could sneak into Benedict Lightwood's house. Tessa met Nate, who danced with Jessamine, and reminded her that she was now 'Jessamine Gray'.
<p>On the balcony at Benedict Lightwood's estate, Tessa and Will shared a rather intimate moment, which was interrupted by Magnus Bane. He was the one who helped them to get back outside of the house.
<p>Later, Tessa once again Changed into Jessamine to meet Nate in a warehouse. However, that was a trap, as Nate had recognized his sister. Afterwards, Tessa was severely injured and Nate was fatally wounded.
<p>Jem proposed to Tessa, and gave her his mother's jade pendant as a token of their engagement. However, Will arrived back from Magnus' house after the demon, Marbas, revealed that there was no curse on him. He talked to Tessa in private and declared his love for her, but she rejected him and told him that she was engaged to Jem.
<p>Sometime after weeks of preparing for the wedding, Tessa finally realized that she was half-Shadowhunter, half-demon—an entirely new hybrid and immortal species that Mortmain wanted to progenerate with her.
<p>She was kidnapped in an assault on the Institute at the delivery of Jessamine from the Silent City where she was taken to the Magister, who had taken up refuge in Cadair Idris near Will and Cecily's former home. Will then came and found them, but his long trip was to no avail as he was captured by his own stupidity and Mortmain's invisible wall. The rest of the Enclave then showed up, accompanied by three Silent Brothers: Enoch, Micah, and Zachariah.
<p>In the fight with the Infernal Devices, it was revealed that her fiancé, Jem, had become a Silent Brother, Brother Zachariah. Since Silent Brothers cannot marry, they were separated.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>married life &amp; beyond</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Tessa married Will on March 3, 1880. When around strangers, Tessa glamoured herself to appear older and look around the same age as Will. During their thirtieth wedding anniversary, Will took the bracelet Tessa wore on their wedding, which bore the wedding runes she could not, and had it redesigned with pearls.
<p>Tessa stayed with Will until his death in 1937. Afterwards, Tessa left London and stayed in Paris for ten years. She shared an apartment with Magnus for the first five, and he, along with his friends Catarina Loss and Ragnor Fell, helped her cope with her losses. During this time, she had brief stay with Catarina back in London for World War II. Despite her children continuously asked her to leave for New York, she and Catarina shared a small apartment and worked as nurses with the nearby hospital, St. Bart's. She was almost thankful for the war as it gave her something useful to do that kept her distracted from her grief. Luckily she was there when Brother Zachariah was injured and brought in. After nearly dying, the two of them found their way back to one another as he had kept his distance feeling he could not comfort her grief. It was that night that Tessa learned there was a lost line of Herondales somewhere out there, and she asked to be a part of his quest in finding them, for Will.
<p>While she hoped not to have to go through the pain of seeing her own children grow old and die, she remained in contact and still visited them and her grandchildren often. She also went back to using 'Gray' as her surname.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>labyrinth refuge</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Tessa began traveling at one point, staying particularly long at Los Angeles, where she kept an eye on her daughter's descendants, the Blackthorns, from afar.
<p>Two years after the Uprising, Tessa was staying with Magnus in New York when Jocelyn Fairchild came to ask him to protect her daughter, Clary. Tessa, in the place of an Iron Sister, then performed the Shadowhunter children's ritual on Clary with Brother Zachariah. Pleased to meet her, Jocelyn took up the surname "Fray", a portmanteau of Fairchild and Gray, in honor of Tessa's friendship with her ancestors.
<p>Saddened by the Uprising, and the thought that the Herondales, the line of her and her husband, were gone, Tessa retreated to the Spiral Labyrinth and spent most of her time there, away from the rest of the world and its troubles. She instead focused on her research as a more scholarly warlock, aiding the Nephilim on occasion.
<p>In September 2007, Tessa participated and fought in the Mortal War at Alicante. Some time after the battle, she found out that Stephen Herondale's son, Jace, was in fact alive. She hoped to speak with him, though Magnus told her to give him some time to accept his own lineage before she burdens him with the past. While speaking with Magnus, Clary noticed her and even vaguely remembered her, thinking she was familiar, but did not remember from when. At that time, Tessa was wearing white, mourning certain deaths, such as Ragnor's. Tessa returned to the Labyrinth afterwards.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>full circle</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>In January 2008, during their annual meet-up at the Blackfriars Bridge, Jem surprised her by arriving as a mortal, no longer a Silent Brother nor dependent on his yin fen as he has been cured by Jace Herondale and his heavenly fire. Though surprised, Tessa welcomed him back into her life wholeheartedly, and the pair rekindled their relationship, sharing a kiss at the bridge. They agreed to see the world together, and Jem told her the "story of Lightwoods and Herondales and Fairchilds".
<p>In May, they attended the wedding of Jocelyn and Luke. There, Jocelyn formally introduced her to Clary, who slightly recognized her. During the conversation, Tessa told Clary that she felt a kinship towards their families, and gave her her copy of the Shadowhunter's Codex, as well as the Herondale family ring that was once her son's, James, to pass onto Jace. While Jace has finally accepted the Herondale name, she, and Magnus, still opted to give him a bit more time to adjust and be happy on his own.
<p>The following year, she and Jem got married in London, on the Blackfriars Bridge, attended by their new friends, as well as old ones—the ghosts of Jessamine and Will.
<p>Though they had found the Lost Herondale—a line descended from Tobias Herondale—many years ago, Tessa and Jem were still looking to find out why she had to stay hidden. In 2012, they found a lead in the Buenos Aires Shadow Market that could tell them more about the threat. With the help of Alec Lightwood, they were able to gain access to the Shadow Market and speak to Mother Hawthorn. She told them the story of the First Heir and how she had fallen in love with Roland Loss. How the Unseelie King had sent the Riders of Mannan to kill her to keep the prophecy of "Faerie falling under shadow" when she reached for her full power secret. That they still hunt her line to this day to prevent it from coming true.
<p>They soon began their search for her again, worried she did not know the true danger she was in and needed to be warned. Their search culminated in August 2012 when Rosemary reached out to them. Though they had been too late to save her, with her dying breath she asked them to save her son. After Changing into her, Tessa got a lead on where he may be and, following that lead, the couple scouted the Shadow Market. Her power to Change acted up during the trip. After she was fatally injured, Tessa found herself stuck in the Change, ultimately saving her from death, and Brother Enoch informed her that it was because she was pregnant. Tessa waited until after they'd saved Kit Herondale and safely deposited him at the Los Angeles Institute with Emma and the Blackthorns before telling Jem.
<p>Tessa visited Kit in the Silent City, where they kept him after the battle during the moments when they gauged the threat to his identity, then asked him to move with her and Jem to Devon and be part of their family. Tessa was surprised but pleased to hear Kit accept, and they left soon afterwards. They moved to Jem's house Cirenworth in Devon, England.
<p>In March 2013, Tessa went into labor in the conservatory, with Jem playing on his cello to try and soothe her while she paced around the room. In that moment, the ghost of Livia Blackthorn entered unbeknownst to anyone in the room, and started having thoughts about entering Tessa's unborn child to have a chance at a second life. Ty's voice, however, called her back to reality; in her shock and distress, she caused the walls of the conservatory to explode, alarming both Tessa and Jem, who thought it might be demons. Magnus Bane appeared and, noticing Livvy, assured them that all was well. After accepting some herbs from him, Tessa allowed Jem to walk her back towards the house, where she later gave birth to her daughter. They named her Wilhelmina, after their beloved Will, nicknamed Mina.
<p>Tessa and Jem's family, which now included Kit and Mina, fell into a sort of routine. She and Jem continued to take care of and make Kit feel loved and comfortable, helping him come to terms with his losses.

<div id="hc"><p>Tessa is an intelligent person. She is brave and strong-willed, and is incredibly caring. While she is generally warm, kind and understanding, Tessa can sometimes be very stubborn. She is also immensely curious and intensely determined when she decides to be.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>physical description</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Tessa has smooth, thick, wavy brown hair, steely gray-blue eyes, an oval face, and a slender body. She is around 5'9—considerably taller than most girls and boys her age (before she stopped aging) at that time. While she used to think herself average, several of her friends have noted that Tessa is pretty and beautiful; not conventionally beautiful, but kindly attractive. Being immortal, Tessa stopped aging young and appears like a young woman in her early twenties.
<p>According to Aloysius Starkweather, she strongly resembles her maternal grandmother—his daughter-in-law.

<br />

<center><h3>skills &amp; abilites</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p><b>Immortality:</b> Tessa is immortal, having maintained her youthful appearance since the 19th century.
<p><b>Magic:</b> After gaining the ability to perform basic warlock magic, Tessa began practicing magic over the years and has even spent some time researching among warlocks at the Spiral Labyrinth.
<p><b>Changing:</b> As a child of an Eidolon demon, she has inherited the ability to Change; the demonic power to shape-shift into another person. Unlike ordinary Eidolon demons like Mrs. Dark, Tessa can become whomever she transforms into as long as she has a physical object of theirs when she first turns into them. She achieves the Change by linking with a psychic impression or remnant of a person contained within an object. She can also Change by linking with a person's soul, as she did when she Changed into the Angel Ithuriel. In addition to their physical presence, Tessa is also able to touch the mind of a person and access their memories and thoughts when Changing, taking on their memories, mannerisms, and abilities. After the events in Cadair Idris, Tessa's powers changed due to the heavenly fire. "There are some things she can no longer do, and some things she can do that she couldn't do before. She can no longer read the minds of people when she changes into them; however, she can do some basic warlock magic she couldn't before.”

<center><h3>possessions</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p><b>Clockwork angel:</b> the clockwork pendant designed to protect her. It was given to Tessa's mother by Mortmain. It contained the angel Ithuriel's soul and when he was freed, Tessa stopped wearing the necklace.
<p><b>Jade pendant:</b> the whitish-green pendant Jem gave Tessa when he proposed to her. It was first given to his mother by his father. It has Chinese characters carved into it which translates to "When two people are at one in their inmost hearts, they shatter even the strength of iron or bronze," from the I Ching, the Book of Changes.
<p><b>Pearl bracelet:</b> the bracelet Tessa wore for her wedding with Will. The marriage runes were placed on the bracelet instead of her skin. On their thirtieth wedding anniversary, Will had it redesigned with pearls.

<p>&#9642; Tessa hates chocolates
<p>&#9642; Because of her Shadowhunter blood, Tessa is seemingly immune to the harmful effects of runes on other beings. Charlotte mentioned that they had attempted to use healing runes on her and the ink merely sank into her skin.
<p>&#9642; Tessa always wore the pearl bracelet given to her by Will on their thirtieth-anniversary and the jade necklace given to her by Jem when he proposed to her.
<p>&#9642; As of the 21st century, Tessa apparently has around fifty living descendants.
<p>&#9642; Tessa chooses to go by her "warlock name", a one syllable surname, Gray, as she does not want to be identified as a Shadowhunter, despite technically being a Starkweather by birth, and a Herondale and Carstairs by marriage.
<p>&#9642; Jocelyn Fray formed their mundane surname "Fray", a portmanteau of Fairchild and Gray, as an homage to Tessa and her close relationship with the Fairchilds.
<p>&#9642; Tessa's favorite ice cream flavor is ginger.
<p>&#9642; Tessa and Will's wedding date was initially set to be March 9th, 1879; However she later changed the date to March 3rd, 1880.
<p>&#9642; Tessa talks in her sleep.
<p>&#9642; During her time living with Magnus after Will's death, the pair developed routines. Though she eventually moved out when she realized that Magnus' flamboyant lifestyle was not for her.

<center><h3>the man behind the fa&ccedil;ade</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>born september 15th to upper middle class parents, eames had as normal childhood as one could have given his circumstances. technically his parents were married, but to look at them one would have never guessed. living in an affluent part of london, he was given whatever it was he wanted, and then some. as a child it was the best thing that could have happened to him. unfortunately, as he grew up he found himself bored with having any and every thing just handed to him. he had always had a knack for art, and out of boredom turned to reproducing in sketch form the famous pieces of art that hung in his parents house. it was these reproductions that garnered the attention of his friends; friends who just happened to have criminal connections.
<p>During his last years in school, he would have preferred to have spent his time working on forgeries instead of his own school work. At night when he was supposed to have been studying, Eames could be found in a room with about a half dozen others working to perfect his craft. He absolutely hated it, hated the fact he had to make multiple copies of the same document until the man who’d brought him on was pleased with it. Some nights it could be two dozen copies, other nights it could be one dozen. Either way, he found himself reconsidering exactly what he was doing. It was only when one of the others he’d become friends with had gone missing did he realize that there was no way out. At least not completely.
<p>This went on for months &#8212; days spent pretending he was a student, while the nights were spent forging different documents. Most of what they had him work on were simple banking documents, wills, and the likes. Nothing that would be scrutinized too closely. And for the most part he was okay with that. Eames knew that it was better than sitting at home listening to his parents bitch about this and that and which functions they would all need to attend. Anything was better than that, and he actually worked hard at what he did, slowly working his way up the ranks so that one day he wouldn’t have to be the one doing all the grunt work.
<p>It wasn’t until one night, close to graduation, that he was caught. His parents were supposed to be out at some function, and instead they had decided at the last minute not to go. Eames was already at ‘work’ at the time, and had no idea until he returned to find them ready for some sort of explanation. It was one of the few times they were a united front. Normally, he could look anyone straight in the face and lie to them. His parents were the only exception. They knew he was up to no good, and left him with an ultimatum. Once he was finished with school he would be shipped off to the military, and he would cut ties with everyone that had dragged him into the life of crime.
<p>To say he was thrilled was a complete understatement. He just made more of an effort to conceal his work, though he also made it known to his employers that he would need to make his leave. Not completely, of course. Eames knew that wasn’t possible. Just long enough for him to complete his stint, and then he would return to work for them. His employers weren’t pleased but he had proved himself over the months, and they were willing to allow him to go with the understanding that once he was done he would return to work for them whenever they needed it. The deal wasn’t one he would have normally made, but knowing it was either that or his life he decided to take it. One day he would find a way to break away and make a name for himself. But until then he could handle the jobs they had.
<p>The military was quite the eye opening experience. He found out just how much he loathed killing people, or at least the possibility. If push came to shove he would do as ordered, but he never found the joy of it like some of the others in his company. The only thing he found he could marginally enjoy was the explosives training. Eames felt like he could be detached from the possibility of actually killing people. Oddly enough it was something he eventually thrived in, working his way up the ranks, and eventually becoming an expert. It was this expertise that lead him to being picked for a special forces unit, and eventually being chosen for Project Somnacin.
<p>And after that? Eames dropped off the map, and his history is a bit murky. Mostly dead ends, and false leads. No one knows exactly who Eames is, and it’s exactly how he wants it.

<p>these relationships exist in each and every verse <b>no matter what</b>.<br /><br />

<center><h3>emily eames</h3></center>
<p>
<div id="verse">
<div id="left"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7FM6UGB.png"></div>
<b>emily eames</b> &mdash; Emily was supposed to be nothing more than a one night stand, a drunken tumble between the sheets while on leave from the army. Eames had no plans on ever seeing her again. Not until she found a way of contacting him during his first month in his new military assignment. Upon finding out that she was pregnant, he told her that he would do the right thing, that he wouldn't just abandon her. And after sneaking off base, they were married in a small civil ceremony.<br /><br />
While Eames wasn't looking for love, he found himself falling more and more in love with Emily as they awaited the birth of their child. He even went so far as to introduce her to Benji and eventually the three of them were the best of friends. Emily was his world and he could never see himself in a position where she wasn't in it. Once their daughter was born the feelings only grew stronger. He loved his family, and enjoyed having them to come home to. Unfortunately, those he worked for found his new found loyalty a hindrance. It was a rainy night when Emily, along with Cora, were killed in a car crash. While local law enforcement said it was nothing more than an accident due to the weather, Eames knew it was more than that. He had no proof and as a criminal knew there was nothing he could do. With his world shattered, all he could do was remember the love Emily had given him.

<p>
<div id="verse">
<div id="left"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/L41lf2z.png"></div>
<b>cora eames</b> &mdash; Cora was the light of Eames' life. More so than his wife. With curly red hair, and storm blue-grey eyes, she was a spitting image of her parents. She also took after her father with her stubbornness and ability to charm just about anyone she met. Which was a good thing most of the time. In those rare times when Eames needed to discipline her, he and Emily found out just how bad it was that their daughter inherited that particular trait. Of course she did inherit her mother's ability to sleep through just about anything, and her fashion sense. Eames did anything and everything for Cora. She thought him what it was to love unconditionally. It was a rainy night when Cora, along with her mum Emily, were killed in a car crash. With the light of his life gone, Eames found himself closing off to anyone and everyone around him, and throwing himself head first into work.

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>the file</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>&#9642; <b>FULL NAME:</b> Zane Balthazar Lennon
<p>&#9642; <b>ALIASES/NICKNAMES:</b> Beatle, Balts 
<p>&#9642; <b>DATE OF BIRTH:</b> September 19, 1986
<p>&#9642; <b>PROFESSION:</b> Forger
<p>&#9642; <b>SEXUALITY:</b>  Zane considers himself indiscriminate, meaning it doesn't matter if it's a man, or a woman. If he finds you attractive, he will use his charm to bring you back to his bed. He's also never been one for long term relationships, and prefers a casual fling to something more serious. In his line of work, attachments tend to be dangerous, and being unattached just works for him.
<p>&#9642; <b>BODY TYPE:</b> 6' in height, and roughly 180 lbs. He's not skinny, per se, but neither is he built. What little weight he does have is all muscle.
<p>&#9642; <b>CLOTHING:</b> If anything, Zane is a creature of comfort. Meaning you're more likely to find him in jeans, and a t-shirt, than some three piece suit. Most of his wardrobe consists of designer jeans, and t-shirts in multiple shades of black, blue, grey, and green, as well as the occasional pair of sweats. Of course, if the situation calls for it, he does have suits that he will wear. He will just bitch, and moan, about being uncomfortable and out of his element.
<p>&#9642; <b>DISTINCTIVE FEATURES:</b> Upon first glance, one tends to notice Zane's eyes, as they tend to cycle through various shades of green depending on his mood. The darker they are, the more likely it is that you will end up flat on your back. He also has a unique celtic tattoo that covers most of his right arm, and shoulder. After his first forging job went south, and he was shot, he decided that the tattoo was a good way to hide the very ugly scar that came from the wound. It is one of his own creations, consisting of celtic knots, celtic dragons, and basic tribal elements. There is also a miniaturized version of Van Gogh's Starry Night portrait on the left side of his chest, as a reminder of his mother, and his roots.
<p>&#9642; <b>PERSONALITY:</b> Zane likes to think he's just a simple person, just looking for some fun outside the boundaries of the law. Although he knows that there is no such thing as being simple, should anyone ask him, he will always deny he's anything but. His out-going personality tends to conflict with that fact. Making things worse, is the fact that at times, he can be quiet, almost to the point of being shy. No one really notices it, because he's always interacting with people, making certain everyone knows he's quite comfortable in his own skin. Most of the time, the struggle between being his usual self, and the shy, scared little boy, is under control. But when faced with a situation that makes him doubt himself, the war flares up, and those times, he wishes for the comfort of his sketchpad.
<p>He also considers himself quite an adventurous person, almost bordering on restless, preferring not to spend too much time in one place. Having spent a majority of his life in one city, Zane always wanted to travel, and see what else the world offered. Staying in one place meant he easily got bored, and when he became bored, trouble usually followed. On the flip side, his bouts of boredom tend to lend themselves to his determination, and perfectionism. When left with his own thoughts, Zane tends to look over all his previous works, finding each and every little flaw, and wanting to do better. Each flaw only spurs him to do better, and that determination tends to overflow into whichever job he may currently be working.
<p>Unfortunately, he's also easily frustrated. Especially when a job doesn't go his way, or when he has to deal with incompetent people. Zane tries very hard not to let people, or jobs, get to him, as he prefers people to think of him as easygoing, and not some sort of hard ass. Most of the time, he can get along with anyone who crosses his path. The instant they prove to him otherwise, he finds himself seeing them through a different lens, and as such, finds himself getting frustrated at the drop of a hat. Time, unfortunately, is the only thing that calms him down.
<p>&#9642; <b>LIKES:</b> Van Gogh, post-impressionist paintings, Beethoven, Mozart, replicating his art idols, being spontaneous, art museums, travelling, learning new languages, drawing
<p>&#9642; <b>DISLIKES:</b> staying in one place for long periods of time, renaissance painters, Italy, sitting in complete silence, three piece suits, formal parties, laziness
<p>&#9642; <b>HOPES AND DREAMS:</b> being the best forger there is, making enough from dream-sharing that he can enjoy painting and drawing without worry, making his mother proud, one day accepting the fact that loyalty & perfection aren't weaknesses, owning the real starry night portrait and not just his own forgery
<p>&#9642; <b>FEARS:</b> being alone, becoming a failure, death, his parents finding out just what he does, disappointing people (and his own mother)
<p>&#9642; <b>STRENGTHS:</b> being a perfectionist, attention to detail, loyalty to those he considers friends, his determination, he's a damn good shot
<p>&#9642; <b>WEAKNESSES:</b> his arrogance, his quick temper, being a perfectionist, his loyalty, his determination, his thrill seeking nature

<center><h3>dreamsharing</h3></center>
<div id="hc"><p>Zane found out about dream-sharing from his partner in crime, Michel. While they tended to work real world jobs, he quickly found himself becoming bored, and wanting something that would actually push his skills. Until one day, Michel offered him a new world, where his forgeries could take on a whole new level, and where he was less likely to become bored. Curiosity killed the cat, and given the fact it was dangerous, just added to the thrill. It wasn't something he was going to turn down. Not when it could only push himself to become better.

<center><h3>history</h3></center>
<p>As the only child of  rich, American ex-pats in London, Zane spent most of his time being shuffled between nannies, and chaperones. His mother tried to be a parent to him, taking him to art museums, and the likes, but in the end, she preferred spending her time alone, with her own dying art career than taking care of her only child. His father, on the other hand, made it perfectly clear that he would have nothing to do with him, other than to make certain he was well educated, and had money available to him for whatever he desired. This hands off approach left him constantly trying to find ways not only to entertain himself, but to garner some sort of attention, whether that was from those who looked after him, or his actual parents. When his mother did actually decide to be a parent, they would spend hours upon hours at the different art museums in London, and one long weekend, took in the museums of Paris. That was the summer before his life started upon the path that led him to the life of crime. It was also when he'd decided to take up drawing, and art, seriously. Much to his mother's delight.
<p>During his last years in school, Zane found out that his <i>talents</i> for art, also favoured recreating identification cards, and drivers licenses. The first time was for a classmate, a boy who wanted to be old enough to enter a club without anyone having to actually question the legality of his ID.  It wasn't his best work, but it passed the bouncer inspection, and had he known how popular his <i>skills</i> were going to be, he would have actually charged for the first one. After that, word got around through school, that if you wanted an ID made, Zane Lennon was the person to speak to. The first few times were his close friends, wanting their licenses to make them old enough to go clubbing, or buy alcohol, or whatever it was they wanted to do. He'd learned it was best not to ask any questions. Plausible deniability, and all that. When random kids from their school started making inquires, he knew he had something good. It was then that he decided to charge, rather handsomely, for his work. He also decided to actually put an effort into it, knowing that one bad word, and his reputation would be ruined. The money wasn't something he <i>needed</i>, per se, but it was something he enjoyed. Even more so, knowing his father would have had a fit if he knew what his son was up to.
<p>By the time he hit eighteen, and officially graduated from school, his reputation had already preceded him. Some of Zane's contacts had passed his name along to some <i>friends</i>, and those friends wanted his particular skill set for a few jobs. Of course, they would pay him, and more than he would charge for his regular work, but they also required him to learn a few new skills. Mostly how to shoot, and if possible, the fine art of thievery. Forgery was something he was good at. Thieving wasn't something he'd honestly thought about. And learning how to fire a gun? It had crossed his mind a time or two. Especially when he'd been forced to attend some of the social functions that his father held. But that was all it had been. Just a passing thought. Then again, he enjoyed the money, and the actual craft of forging, and if he could make a career out of it, he would. Learning how to use a gun had been easy, and something he picked up relatively quickly. The thieving? The first time he tried to pick someone's pocket, he almost ended up arrested. But after getting a few tips, and practising on some of his friends, had it down pat, as well. But it would never been his strength. Not like recreating a Rembrandt, in all its glory.
<p>His first job as a thief slash forger had been an utter nightmare. Zane would remember it for the rest of his life. Not to mention the scar that he got from being shot. The boss of his crew had thought it would be a good idea to screw over their client, and in the end, most of them had ended up either wounded, or worse. He hadn't stuck around long enough to find out what happened to the others. It was then that he decided to work by himself, instead of aligning himself with some group. Too many people, too many conflicting ideas, came with working in a group. Working by himself meant he was only accountable to himself. It also meant he would keep all of the money. Being a solo act wasn't easy, but after almost a year, he'd made a name for himself, and anyone who wanted passports, birth certificates, or any other sort of forgery done, knew exactly who to go do. He was actually quite proud of himself, and of the work he did. Though, he still refused to let his parents in on the exact details, preferring a well crafted lie to the truth. It wasn't as if they actually cared what he did. Just as long as he didn't end up dead somewhere.
<p>Meeting Michel, two years after leaving school, was another one of his life changing moments. Zane had been hired to work on some passports, something he could almost do blindfolded, if he were honest with himself, and the plan was to meet at one of the nightclubs in Soho. That part of London wasn't his usual hangout, but he knew enough about the area to be weary. He also knew enough about people to be leery of meeting in a nightclub, to discuss business of all things. But a job was a job, and the man was willing to pay a little extra than his usual clients, so who was he to refuse. Upon seeing the man, his first impression had been that of a businessman, not unlike his own father. His usual clients never came to meetings in three piece suits, and looked like they'd just stepped out of some building near Canary Wharf. But the man was willing to pay, and Zane was more than willing to offer his services. For a price, of course. But they'd never gotten to that point in their conversation. The club was raided, and while he was a bit fuzzy on the details, he did remember Michel making certain they both made it out of the club in one piece. 
<p>He'd always told himself he would never work with someone else again, would never rely on anyone other than himself to get out of a situation. But Michel changed his opinion on working with someone, and when he'd suggested they work together again sometime, he agreed, wondering if the man was being polite, or if he truly meant it. It hadn't taken more than a few weeks before his mobile was ringing, and Michel offered him yet another job. Zane had actually been hesitant about it, but when he'd been told the details, knew it wasn't something he could turn down. The job was one of his easiest yet, and he had actually enjoyed working with Michel. Not to mention the multiple zeros that ended up in his bank account. Though, it was one job, and then it was back to the grind. He wasn't cut out for working in a group, and while he was bored of working in London, he knew it meant safety. He knew the city like the back of his hand. Though, he wasn't opposed to working with his new partner. Especially, if it meant getting out of the city. Zane wasn't sure he could trust Michel, but they worked well together. Better than any of the people from his first crew. 
<p>Maybe that was a sign. Or maybe, he was just being childish. But he'd agreed to travel with Michel. As long as he could work a few jobs on the side. Old habits die hard, after all. Zane actually decided against working any jobs that didn't involve his new partner when he almost lost his life at the hands of some thug. It wasn't his fault the man was younger than he looked, and he hadn't given any specifics other than what he needed. Working with a partner wasn't so bad, after that, and he found himself slowly trusting Michel. Soon, they never worked without the other, and their partnership was one he actually felt safe in. Like he'd felt back in London. Michel was the older brother he'd never had, and actually looked to him as such. He refused to go anywhere without him. When he was invited into the world of dream-sharing, Zane knew his life would once again change. For the better? He hadn't a clue. But he knew Michel wouldn't willingly put them in harm's way. They'd made a name for themselves in the real world, and he had a feeling the same would happen in the dream-sharing world. And his feelings were very rarely wrong.

<center><h3>trivia</h3></center>
<div id="hc"><p>&#9642; Zane is actually ambidextrous, and while he's never kept it a secret, he's never announced it either. If people watch him long enough, it's something they will pick up. 
<p>&#9642; He's also become a natural at reading people, finding their flaws, and weaknesses, just by watching them. 
<p>&#9642; He also has this really bad habit of pacing when stressed, or needing to think. Many times, he's been told not to, but it's something he can't help. It's just a part of him, like his quick temper. 
<p>&#9642; There's also this quirk about him where he's more likely to shoot first, ask questions never. But that only happens when he feels like he's been fucked over one too many times by the same person. Or when he's just had enough of a situation.

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>the file</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>&#9642; <b>FULL NAME:</b> Rowyn Finley Langston
<p>&#9642; <b>ALIASES/NICKNAMES:</b> Fin, Finley, Senior Officer Langston 
<p>&#9642; <b>DATE OF BIRTH:</b> June 6, 1981
<p>&#9642; <b>PROFESSION:</b> CIA Analyst (Chief Interrogator in Special Projects involving dreamsharing)
<p>&#9642; <b>SEXUALITY:</b>  Finley considers herself bisexual and asexual. When she does show interest in someone it tends to be more towards men than women. She’s extremely focused on the job and anything outside of that isn’t something she focuses on. If she does find someone attractive or if someone piqued her interest she will use what she’s learned on the job and call it flirting. She also prefers something casual instead of something long term. As a workaholic she has no time for relationships.
<p>&#9642; <b>BODY TYPE:</b> 5'6 in height, and roughly 150 lbs. She’s not stick skinny perse, but neither is she built. Finley has the muscle required of the job and from working out when she’s not at Langley.
<p>&#9642; <b>CLOTHING:</b> Finely definitely believes in professional attire. Anytime she’s at Langley you’ll find her in pants suits and heels, usually black or a mix of black and red or blue. She’s never been one to wear skirts and she avoids them as much as possible. When she’s not at Langley or when she’s off work, she will tend to wear jeans, a collared shirt and a black leather jacket along with combat boots. Comfort to most isn’t comfort to her and while she will wear sweats while at her brownstone in DuPont Circle. 
<p>&#9642; <b>DISTINCTIVE FEATURES:</b> Upon first glance, one tends to notice Finley’s hair. Depending on the light it will either be bright copper red or a faded red. The next thing people notice are her eyes. They tend to be a green blue and depending on the light they look either ice blue or green. When she’s angry they tend to take on a more green hue and when she’s calm they tend to look more icy blue. She also has a scar down the inside of her left knee from surgery she had in high school as well as a scar on her right palm from when she was accidentally stabbed during her time at the Farm. 
<p>&#9642; <b>PERSONALITY:</b> Finley is quite a complex person. Other than being a workaholic, she comes across as someone who enjoys knowing the sorts of secrets she knows. She’s also very dominant, something she learned early on while she was at University and something she honed during her time at the Farm. People always seem to think she’s a pushover because she’s shorter than a lot of her colleagues but the first time they try that they find out that she’s unwilling to take their shit. 
<p>Even when she’s not working her personality is still very  dominant. There are those times when she likes to be the life of the party or the centre of attention, but most of the times she’s content with ordering those around her. Finley has always been the sort who leads instead of following. During her time at the Farm she was constantly taking on the leader role and when she was meant to follow she would still take over because she felt those around her were incompetent. 
<p>She’s also the sort to say what is on her mind. Finley sees no point in beating around the bush and will bluntly tell someone what she thinks of them. More times than not she’s lost friends and work partners because of that. Only recently have they found people able to handle that about her. In her personal life, not many people consider her friend because of her very outgoing and dominating personality.
<p>&#9642; <b>LIKES:</b> Yoga, meditation, travelling, and learning languages. She also loves coming home and enjoying a nice glass of wine or other strong alcohol. Finley has quite the collection during her travels with the CIA.
<p>&#9642; <b>DISLIKES:</b> laziness, incompetence, inability to take control of a situation, idle conversations and parties.
<p>&#9642; <b>HOPES AND DREAMS:</b> Finley hadn’t thought much about the future other than to work her way up through the military. After 9/11 she honestly thought about joining the military and had the CIA not come calling she would have done that. Instead, she’s worked her way up through the CIA and being the head interrogation of special projects involving dreamsharing has been a dream come true for her.
<p>&#9642; <b>FEARS:</b> being alone, becoming a failure, death, losing herself in the dream
<p>&#9642; <b>STRENGTHS:</b> being a perfectionist, attention to detail, loyalty
<p>&#9642; <b>WEAKNESSES:</b> being a perfectionist, her loyalty, her determination, her workaholic nature

<center><h3>dreamsharing</h3></center>
<div id="hc"><p>Finley found out about dreamsharing when the military came to her university and looked for volunteers through the psychology program. There were strict guidelines in place and not everyone who applied made it to Project Somnasin, but Finley was one of the lucky ones. While most of those in the project were military men, they wanted civilians to see if they could handle it or if they could end up training those soldiers in the future. She aced all of their tests and while she took the pointman role, she did find out that she could forge if worse came to worse. It wasn’t her strength and the military saw that, but she did make an attempt to try it just in case there was need for her in the future.</div>
<p>
<p>
<center><h3>history</h3></center>
<p>Born to Sean and Cara Langston, Finley was an only child who wanted for nothing. Her parents noticed early on that she was smarter than her peers and picked up on things quicker than they did. Once they realised that they brought in tutors to constantly challenge her mind and to keep her from becoming bored. They refused to skip grades for her, wanting their child to have peers her own age. During her childhood Finley was frustrated with having the knowledge she did while her own peers were woefully lacking. And that frustration only grew the older she got. She never allowed it to manifest in physical ways. She’d never be the type who screamed out in frustration. Instead, she focused all of that frustration into making certain she never had to be frustrated again.
<p>Because of her tutoring as a child, Finley was able to graduate early from the University of Michigan with a degree in psychology. She hadn’t thought about the military but other than  going to graduate school there wasn’t much more she could do. There was also the fact that during her time at university she was involved in a secret experiment in conjunction with Project Somnasin. As a psychology student and teaching assistant she was involved in her fair share of projects. But her advisor mentioned another project where he felt her organisational skills would come in handy. Never did she think she would be involved in something like dreamsharing. No one even knew it existed.
<p>She flourished within the project and became one of their top prospects. To the point that the military was going to hire her to help train more soldiers to adjust to the world of war. It was a tempting offer and after graduation one she was thinking about taking. Finley got another job offer, one from the federal government and she took the summer after graduation to contemplate her options. She knew her parents would be supportive no matter what. Either decision would change her life and she couldn’t figure out which path she would take. Until that fateful September day… 
<p>September 11th changed in her ways she hadn’t thought. Her parents were killed when their plane slammed into the north tower in New York and that one event made her choice for her. While the military was her initial choice, she knew the government would allow her to find those who killed her parents. The CIA made her an offer she couldn’t refuse and after her time at the Farm she found herself assigned to a section where she could put her languages and psychology degree to use. Finley had no desire to work in the field and after returning to school to finish her masters, she managed to work her way up the interrogation chain. 
<p>Once she was in a position where she could suggest things, she suggested they bring in dreamsharing in an attempt to interrogate those they brought in during their 9/11 investigations. It took a lot of convincing, but in the end Finley was able to put together a special division that used dreamsharing to interrogate prisoners. Unfortunately, it meant bringing in those who were able to forge people in the dream, but given they worked at black sites and could easily bring in those they needed without them knowing. It would also open the door for other operations to use her techniques. Though, she will not let anyone else take credit for the fact that she’d brought this into the CIA and that it was quietly becoming known as the go to for those who didn’t break under their usual techniques.

<center><h3>trivia</h3></center>
<div id="hc"><p>&#9642; Finley talks with her hands and sometimes uses sign language while holding a conversation. Most people just assume she’s using her hands to make a point, those who know sign will pick up on the rudimentary signs that she uses while holding a conversation.
<p>&#9642; Being an interrogator means she knows how to not only read people but manipulate them to give her the answers she needs. Unfortunately, it’s something she takes into her personal life as it’s become second nature to her.
<p>&#9642; She’s also left handed and when she’s exhausted you’ll find her in front of her computer with glasses on. Most of the time she wears contacts but after a long day at work she will take them out and wear glasses.

<center><h3>Tutelage at Aretuza</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>In her home town of Vengerberg, Yennefer, a young lady with a curved spine and partial facial paralysis attempts to return a flower to two lustful lovers outside a barn. Disgusted by her appearance, they attack Yennefer, pinning her to the ground and hurling insults her way until she instinctively portals away to Aretuza. There, she meets Istredd, a young sorcerer who informs her that she's been marked. He then creates an untraceable portal to send Yennefer back home.
<p>Having been marked from her portalling from Aretuza, a sorceress named Tissaia de Vries finds Yennefer and purchases her for four marks from her stepfather, less than half the price of a pig. Yennefer's mother objects, prompting her husband to denounce Yennefer as his daughter. Yennefer's cry for help is similarly futile. Yennefer is forcefully taken from her home in Vengerberg and locked in a room in Aretuza. She looks at herself in the mirror, disgusted at what looks back at her, and so shatters the mirror and grabs a shard of glass as she contemplates taking her own life. Despite slitting her wrists, Yennefer survives the night after her failed suicide attempt due to Tissaia's intervention.
<p>Tissaia explains the dangers of magic and how each one of them showed an aptitude for controlling it, making them conduits of chaos, though magic itself is the control of chaos. She has gathered them for a trial: before each of them sits a flower and a stone, and they are to lift the stone without touching it. All of the initiates are able to lift the stone, with the exception of Yennefer. Discouraged by her failed attempt, Yennefer flees the greenhouse. She seeks out Istredd and introduces herself.
<p>Later, The initiates sit across from each other during an exercise to determine their partner's greatest fear. Telepathy should occur; however, after hours of analyzing her partner, Anica, Yennefer has failed to determine her fear and lies to cover up her inadequacies. Tissaia calls Yennefer out for her lie and berates her in front of the class, so Yennefer retreats to Istredd and details her shortcomings. He advises her to keep trying, saying that he didn't give up and now he can read minds. He even helps Yennefer read his mind, revealing glimpses of cicadas, warm bread, and other things that she might enjoy.
<p>The initiates are later taken to Tor Lara to bottle lightning, to test their ability to control the ultimate expression of chaos. On Yennefer's turn, she raises her bottle and fails, causing the lightning to strike her, and send her across the room. Enraged, Yennefer shoots the lightning at Tissaia, who redirects into the sky. Tissaia proceeds to relate to Yennefer, saying there are two types of mages: those who can control their emotions and those who let their emotions control them. Yennefer and Tissaia being the latter.
<p>In her fear of being sent home, Yennefer finds Istredd, who insists that they'll find a way. He can't show Yennefer what he knows because he has to ensure that the knowledge never reaches the Brotherhood. Istredd instead shows her the skulls of the elves who built Aretuza, explaining the Elven history, and how they were the original mages. He gives Yennefer a Feainnewedd, a plant that only grows where Elder Blood has spilt. Using this plant, Yennefer summons a portal with no difficulty and reveals that her real father was a half-elf, and was killed during the Great Cleansing. The half-elf blood caused her to be born with a twisted spine, and she believes that this is why no one could ever love her. Istredd kisses her, as if to prove Yennefer wrong about no one loving her.
<p>Yennefer takes the flower she got from Istredd to Tissaia, as it was a test to see if Yennefer could control her emotions long enough to get it from him. Yennefer asks if this means she's ready to "ascend," and is told to listen for the knock.
<p>Yennefer listens for the knock as instructed. However, it's not her door that Tissaia knocks on. Nevertheless, she takes the opportunity to spy on Tissaia as she turns three of the initiates into eels. Tissaia instructs her to push them into the water. Tissaia took away their control, but they still have power. They're conduits for Aretuza. So when Yennefer takes a broom and pushes them into the water, all of Aretuza lights up with magic.

<center><h3>Ascension to Mage</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>It's initiation day at Aretuza, and Yennefer and Istredd are having sex in front of an illusory audience. Afterwards, they share their mutual fears of being separated with Istredd exploring ruins and Yennefer working as a mage to King Virfuril. Yennefer recalls the frightened girl she once was, completely unaware of her power. She wants to go back home to Aedirn and never be that girl again.
<p>Yennefer meets with the enchanter. Every girl he enchants leaves Aretuza a living work of art, no matter how challenging the task. He allows Yennefer to pick a dress, and she chooses the grey one. Tissaia enters and tells Yennefer that they remake themselves on their terms. Yennefer has the power to "free the victim in the mirror" forever. Tissaia instructs Yennefer to close her eyes and imagine the most powerful woman in the world, and takes that image from her mind and transposes it onto the mirror for Yennefer to see.
<p>Later, Yennefer demands an audience with the Chapter after discovering that she is being sent to Nilfgaard rather than Aedirn as promised. Tissaia reveals that it was her blood that finalized the Chapter's decision. Sending a quarter-elf to Aedirn would only further ostracize Cintra given their hatred for elves. It was Stregobor who told the Chapter about Yennifer's true father, and Yennefer realizes that the only way he could've known is if Istredd told him.
<p>Yennefer refuses to attend the initiation. Istredd finds her in the ruins forging her father's name on a deed to declare her as his natural-born daughter. Istredd apologizes for telling Stregobor her secret, so she wants him to go back to the Chapter and tell them that he lied, but it's too late as Yennefer missed initiation and the enchantments are done. Istredd offers to right his wrong, considering that the Brotherhood offered him a seat on the research chapter, so he wishes to bring Yennefer along. However, she wants more than a life "holding dustpans while he brushes bones." Yennefer storms off, but not before Istredd exclaims that she's just angry because she lost her chance to be beautiful. Not only beauty, Yennefer wants power, she admits. She leaves the unfinished deed behind in her angered retreat.
<p>She finds the enchanter and demands that he make her beautiful. Despite not having the necessary herbs to sedate her during the procedure, Yennefer demands that he go through with it. Yennefer removes her clothes and is strapped to a chair. She requests that the enchanter leave her purple eyes and scars. Before proceeding, he informs Yennefer there is a cost to a creation. To be reborn, Yennefer will bear no more. The enchanter surgically removes Yennefer reproductive organs. He uses them to form a paste that when applied to Yennefer's skin, causes a transformation. Yennefer screams out in pain as internal flames crack her skin. Her body takes shape; her spine forcefully straightens, as does her jaw. The pain is so overwhelming that she breaks free of her chains.
<p>Following a successful enchantment, Yennefer arrives at the Aretuzan ball, catching everyone's eye. Completely reborn, and appearing almost entirely like a new person. She greets the king of Vengerberg, who discards Fringilla in favor of her. The two then dance center floor, and she wins Aedirn as she originally wanted.

<center><h3>Protecting Queen Kalis</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>30 years have passed, and Yennefer hasn't aged a day. She travels with Queen Kalis and her newborn child in a carriage guarded by King Virfuril's soldiers. Many fear for Queen Kalis as she has yet to produce a boy to inherit the throne from Virfuril. Kalis envies Yennefer's life as a king's mage. However, Yennefer gave up everything to get her seat at court, and in return, she's spent the last three miserable decades cleaning up political debacles. Nonetheless, Kalis argues that Yennefer made the right choice until the horse carriage suddenly comes under attack. Yennefer and Queen Kalis exit the carriage to find all but one of the guards dead. Standing no more than 50 feet away is an assassin and a koshchey. Yennefer opens a portal for Kalis, her daughter, the guard, and herself to escape through.
<p>They emerge from the portal in a desert, where Yennefer is fairly certain the assassin was paid to kill Queen Kalis as she's repeatedly failed to provide the king a male heir. The assassin then tracks them to the desert, Yennefer and Kalis managing to escape through another portal while the guard is killed in the process. They now arrive in an undetermined town, and Yennefer asks Kalis if she has something of the king's that could be traced. Confirming her suspicion, the assassin tracks and joins them not a second later, his koshchey lunging at Yennefer. She slows it down long enough for Queen Kalis, the child, and herself to escape through another portal to a mountain top, where Yennefer leaves the queen and her child after being tracked for a third time. Each time Yennefer makes a new portal it seems to take more and more effort to create a new one.
<p>Yennefer appears in a field of sunflowers after having left the queen and her child behind. Yennefer eventually returns to find Kalis dead. She kills the koshchey, takes the child, and portals to safety though not before the assassin throws a knife at her as she goes through the portal. Yennefer emerges on a beach and drags herself and the child to shore. The princess doesn't make it due to the knife having grazed Yennefer and the baby, enough to fatally wound the infant. As the sun sets, Yennefer settles on the beach with the princess' infant body by her side. She believes the child is better off dead rather than having to endure the trials and tribulations of life. She then buries the child beneath the sand.

<center><h3>Trapping a Djinn</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Yennefer enters a shop in search of assistance. Much like herself, the owner of the shop, Hemet, is a mage as well, and both have chosen to live a life off the grid, unbounded by the rules of the Brotherhood. She leaves empty-handed after failing to provide enough pay.
<p>Yennefer starts her own business in Rinde; using her magic to fix the problems of the townspeople, so long as they're willing to pay. She has customers lined down the road until she is confronted by the town mayor, Beau Berrant. He's come to collect what's due to the kingdom, but Yennefer ends up arrested when she refuses to comply.
<p>Yennefer receives a visit from Tissaia, who she hasn't seen in years. Not since she maneuvered her way onto Aedirn court over 30 years ago. Tissaia informs Yennefer that King Virfuril is dead, and King Demavend rules now. Yennefer remained hidden for a while, but now she's making noise in search of a solution to her problem; Yennefer wishes to bear children. Tissaia has come to warn her that the mages that Yennefer is enlisting won't help her with her problem because Yennefer is "pure chaos" at the moment. She wants a cure for her infertility, and it's making her sloppy. The Brotherhood left her to her own devices once she abandoned Aedirn, but her recent behavior will make her a target. Tissaia invites Yennefer to return to Aretuza, but she turns Tissaia down. Yennefer suspects that Tissaia only wants to see her thrive so long as she has a hand in it. Tissaia swears this is not true, and she questions what more Yennefer could possibly want, to which she replies "everything."
<p>That night, Yennefer hosts an orgy consisting of several dozen townspeople. To her surprise, the witcher, Geralt of Rivia, interrupts. She knows him as the White Wolf. He requests her help in saving his ally, Jaskier. She questions just how powerful Geralt is, but Jaskier was attacked by a djinn and whatever it did to him is spreading, so Geralt insists on focusing on him. Should Yennefer cure him, Geralt promises to indulge her curiosity. Yennefer agrees to his terms, and states the phrase "ragamuffin," releasing the citizens of Rinde awaken from their trance, completely unaware of their actions.
<p>Yennefer puts Jaskier in a deep healing sleep. He'll be out long enough for Geralt to bathe, and she's even acquired his clothes. As Geralt bathes, she points out that fishing for a djinn is an extreme measure to remedy sleeplessness. Geralt replies that he's desperate. Yennefer undresses and sits back-to-back with Geralt in the bath. She wonders if all witchers are as blessed as he is, being as they're made from magic, mage magic. However, as Geralt explains, it didn't make for a happy childhood. Judging by Yennefer's scars, he can tell she didn't have much of a happy childhood either. He accuses her of capitalizing on the political situation of Rinde, though Yennefer claims that she's serving the stifled townspeople. Ultimately, they both know there's more to the other's claim than they're revealing. Fortunately for Geralt, Yennefer has decided that his company and conversation is payment enough for her services.
<p>While Geralt doesn't doubt her capabilities, he does doubt her intentions. Yennefer assures Geralt that Jaskier will survive and recover his vocal talents. Geralt looks around and realizes that Yennefer is attempting to trap the djinn. She explains that it's tied to this plane and its master. With Jaskier only making two wishes, Yennefer needs him to make his third and final wish so that she can capture the djinn. Geralt is taken over by the sudden smell of lilac and gooseberries. Yennefer kisses him and at that moment has full control of him. She uses him to enact her revenge against a couple of town council members.
<p>As Yennefer prepares the spell, Jaskier awakens. She holds him against the wall and tells him to make a wish. Jaskier makes his final wish, and Yennefer releases him. She then starts chanting to summon the djinn. Geralt returns, offering his help. He tries to stop Yennefer before the power consumes and kills her. Jaskier expressed his last wish, but the djinn only seems to be getting stronger. That's because as Geralt explains, it is he who has the wishes. He refuses to make the last wish in fear that Yennefer becoming a vessel for the djinn would have her lose control. Yennefer states that true transformation is painful and that she'll take the djinn herself. Yennefer becomes unstable. The house itself starts to collapse. In saving Yennefer from herself and her own desires, Geralt makes his final wish to free the djinn. The building then caves in on them.
<p>Yennefer manages to portal herself and Geralt downstairs before the building comes crashing down on them. She blames him for the djinn's escape and all the havoc it will cause. Geralt informs her that djinn are only dark creatures when they're held captive. He's certain that it won't cause much harm now that it's free. Geralt and Yennefer then have sex. Afterwards, Yennefer asks what he wished for, but Geralt does not reveal it. He then sleeps, soundly.

<center><h3>Hunting a Dragon</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Yennefer and her latest companion Eyck of Denesle were among four teams to join in on a hunt to slay a green dragon. Yennefer greeted Geralt and Jaskier for the first time in a year. She couldn't help but wonder why she kept running into Geralt despite walking the earth for decades prior and never meeting a single witcher. She explained that she was there to accompany Eyck as he was to slay the dragon.
<p>All four groups decide to settle down on the mountainside. Geralt, Jaskier, Borch, Tèa, Vèa, Yennefer, Eyck, Yarpen, the leader of the dwarves, and Boholt, the leader of the Reavers roasted the hirikka and feasted. However, Borch warned Eyck against eating a certain part of the creature. Another warning that went unconsidered by Eyck. "A great knight never wastes a kill", he replied. It's why he'd make a great lord after slaying the dragon. With Yennefer as his mage. Boholt interrupted and made a lewd remark towards Yennefer. Eyck took his leave as his stomach started to gurgle after failing to heed Borch's warning. They proceeded to discuss how the rightful son of Nilfgaard had returned and started burning through the south. With Fringilla as his mage. Wouldn't be long before they tried to take Sodden.
<p>Yennefer awakened the following morning to find Eyck missing. Yarpen found him dead by a tree with his pants down and throat slit. Nevertheless, the hunt continued. Yarpen suspected that the Reavers killed Eyck, and so he knew of a short cut across the mountains that he only shared with Geralt, Jaskier, Borch, Tèa and Vèa. Proposing a truce until they reached the next peak. Geralt tried to convince Yennefer to join them on the shorter path. Much like Yarpen, Yennefer suspected that Boholt killed her escort before he could accomplish the one task she needed him for. Yennefer revealed there are certain healing properties dragons are said to possess. However, Geralt informed her that fertility cures using fresh dragon hearts were a myth. Geralt also didn't believe she'd make a good mother. Yennefer explained that she wanted her choice to bear a child back. Geralt informed her that witchers can't have children either. They were made sterile because their lifestyle weren't suited for a child. He then unintentionally revealed to Yennefer his Child of Surprise.
<p>Yarpen and his men have guided Yennefer, Geralt, Jaskier, Borch, Tèa and Vèa to a fairly narrow path lined with wooden boards alongside the mountain. A tight squeeze for anyone larger than that of a dwarf. The board broke beneath Borch's feet and he falls, as does Tèa and Vèa. The only thing preventing them from plummeting to the ground was Geralt holding on to the other end of the chain. Borch told Geralt to let him go. When Geralt refused, Borch let go of the chain, shortly followed by Tèa and Vèa, and the three of them disappeared within the fog as they fell to the ground below.
<p>While in her tent, Yennefer got a visit from Geralt. Yennefer admitted to being worried for Geralt on the mountain. Her scent was mesmerizing. The moment he dreaded most every time she left is when it faded. Yennefer reminded Geralt that it was he who left first in Rinde. She woke up in the destroyed house, and he was gone. Geralt asked for forgiveness and kissed Yennefer. After having sex, Yennefer questioned if the rumors were true about witchers being devoid of human emotion. Geralt explained that was false. People say whatever justified despising his kind. If the choice had been his, Yennefer wondered what Geralt would've been instead of a witcher. Much like Geralt, Yennefer didn't have much of a choice in being a mage. She always dreamed of becoming important to someone someday. Geralt assured Yennefer that she was important to him.
<p>Yennefer woke up the following morning to find Geralt still at her side. At a quick pace, they could make it back to the Pensive Dragon before sundown, however, Yennefer had no intentions of turning around. She was still intent on killing the dragon. She then rushed off to the dragon's cave after noticing the dwarves were already ahead of her.
<p>Yennefer caught up to the dwarves, freezing them in place, allowing for her to pass them by and enter the cave. Once inside, she found the wounded green dragon protecting its egg. Tèa and Vèa appeared and demanded Yennefer stay back. Geralt arrived soon thereafter. The green dragon was dead, but she was not alone. Enter the gold dragon, who revealed itself to be Borch. When the dragoness was injured, her cry was heard by Villentretenmerth. But the egg could not be moved or the life inside it would die, which is why the dragon attacked. She was as protecting her baby. That's when Borch, Tèa and Vèa heard about the king's hunt and realized they had to keep their enemies close. So Borch came to find Geralt, the knight who was taught to save dragons rather than kill them. Boholt and his gang of Reavers arrive, forcing Geralt, Yennefer, Tèa and Vèa to defend the dragons.
<p>Yennefer and Geralt defended one entrance to the cave while Tèa and Vèa defended the other. They are faced with Boholt and one remaining Reaver. Yennefer made sure that it was her who killed Boholt. Afterwards, Borch paid off Yarpen and his men; offering them teeth belonging to the green dragon to take to the king as proof of its demise.
<p>Borch thanked Geralt and Yennefer for all their help in defending him and his family. He noted that he sees why Geralt didn't want to lose her. Yennefer questioned the meaning behind this, and Geralt revealed that he was referring to Rinde and their encounter with the djinn. That was why they couldn't escape each other. Because Geralt wished for it. Yennefer took that to mean that her feelings for Geralt were also magic, though he insisted that wasn't true. An argument ensued, resulting in the two parting ways. Borch saved them both a lot of hurt with a little pain now. He revealed that Yennefer would never regain her womb, and Geralt would lose Yennefer.

<center><h3>Returning to Aretuza</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Coming from Caingorn, Yennefer arrived in Nazair, a Nilfgaard ran excavation site, where she reunited with Istredd after years apart. Why they're digging? The tunes described a "magnalith" in Nazair, but no one could find it until Istredd arrived and Nilfgaard tore through the lands. They allowed his research. Every glyph had a clue to something across the continent from a time before the Conjunction. Yennefer took a sip of the ale, which she described as having a terrible taste. However, Istredd claimed that the people of Nazair were starving before Nilfgaard's arrival. Yennefer surmised that Istredd "bought in."
<p>She questioned how much longer Istredd intended to stay in Nazair as she missed him. Yennefer asked if it wasn't too late to do what they always talked about all those years ago in the cave of Aretuza. Living a life together. Istredd could excavate as she worked as a mage. He recalled how Yennefer always hated monoliths. Admittedly this was true, but Yennefer had spent decades being the object of desire, having anyone she wanted. But they all loved the power that came with her position at court. Not her actual power. And no one had ever seen that but Istredd. Yennefer kissed him. However, he pulled away. He spent years waiting for the moment that Yennefer realized that they were meant for each other. Coming up with excuses to study at Aedirn. Anything to get closer to her, but every request he made was denied by her. It was Stregobor who snapped him out of it. He reminded Istredd of the beauty of their work. Yennefer went after the thing she loved, so she chose power. At least she kept her eyes, he remarked, before departing.
<p>Yennefer was then approached by Vilgefortz of Roggeveen, who was in need of her help. Nilfgaard had been conscripting mages into their service. And since neither of them possessed a legitimate letter of safe conduct, they both should leave as fast as possible. He needed Yennefer to accompany him back to Aretuza. He and Tissaia needed her help. Tissaia even said herself that Yennefer was the best student she'd ever taught.
<p>Yennefer accompanied him back to Aretuza, where he and Vanielle of Brugge informed her that Nilfgaard was planning to attack Cintra. Not that Yennefer cared. She only cared for finding Tissaia. To her surprise, Tissaia had no idea she was in Aretuza. Vilgefortz lied to Yennefer in hopes of convincing her to join their cause.
<p>Yennefer returned to her old room to find three initiates, Fola, Glacella, and Murta playing around, claiming to be studying botany. They questioned why she's back. A question that not even Yennefer at the time could answer. She offered to show them what the herbs used in botany were truly good for. While the herbs possessed certain healing properties, when mixed, they act as psychedelics. From the girls, Yennefer discovered that Glacella never had a "conduit moment" and that certain initiates were buying their way into the Aretuza.
<p>Yennefer showed the girls a more terrifying fate than being expelled should they get caught. She took them to Aretuza's windmill, where many years prior, she watched Tissaia turn her friends into eels. Yennefer informed the girls that the ability to create life would be taken from them so that when they were sent out into the world, the only family and loyalty they'd have was to Aretuza. Initiates like Glacella, "with all the magical talent of shoe leather," would end up in the water with the rest of Yennefer's sisters who never ascended. Tissaia interrupted Yennefer's schooling of the girls and sent them to their rooms. She went on to tell Yennefer that she should stop with the one life she'd already ruined, that being her own.
<p>Yennefer never wanted to come back, referring to Aretuza as a joke, letting in girls who couldn't even do magic. Tissaia explained that they had to make compromises in order to survive. Tissaia departed after noticing a gathering of the mages, leaving Yennefer clueless. Fortunately, she found Triss Merigold, who told her that an emergency conclave of the Northern Mages was called after Nilfgaard took Marnadal.
<p>Artorius, Stregobor, and Tissaia led the conclave. Artorius and Stregobor had no desire to go to war with Nilfgaard, especially not for Cintra, who rejected their mages for decades. However, Vilgefortz worried that more kingdoms would fall after Cintra as Nilfgaard wanted the entire continent. Rather than watching them fall, Tissaia wanted to help Cintra defeat Nilfgaard. Sabrina, Vilgefortz, and Vanielle sided with Tissaia, wanting to convince the kings to send their armies because if they didn't stop Nilfgaard now, more kingdoms would fall.
<p>Fringilla arrived at the conclave and denounced any suspicion that Nilfgaard was planning to take over the continent. Under their new leader, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, Nilfgaard had strengthened trade and funded research. Fringilla believed that in taking Cintra, they had a chance of saving the continent. If the Northern mages wouldn't take sides, Fringilla asked that they at least stay out of her way. Fringilla then pointed out that if not for Yennefer, she never would've been assigned to Nilfgaard, and it wouldn't be the empire it is today. Artorius joked that had they sent Yennefer to Nilfgaard as planned, it would still be a "shitty backwater." Yennefer admitted this was true. Instead of Nilfgaard, she went to a prized kingdom and did "fuck all for decades." She helped murderers and rapists keep their crown. If given an option, she'd vote to burn it all down. The mages put it to a vote. Unfortunately, most sided with Stregobor and Artorius to allow Cintra to fend for themselves.
<p>Once the conclave concluded, Yennefer and Tissaia resumed their previous discussion. Tissaia insisted that there are girls who need the help that only Aretuza can provide. She also added that Yennefer was right, back in Rinde when Tissaia visited her. But now, they may have to put their differences aside to stop Nilfgaard. Tissaia, Vilgefortz, and some of the other mages planned to fight, and she was hoping Yennefer would join them.
</div>

<br />
<center><h3>Battle of Sodden Hill</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Approximately 60 mages, Yennefer, Tissaia, Triss, Vilgefortz, Vanielle, Coral, and Sabrina included, boarded a ship headed for Sodden Hill. They needed to get to the Elven keep that guarded it before Nilfgaard did. They had already sent word to the Northern kingdoms. Temeria and Kaedwen agreed to join them in defending the land. The plan was to protect the keep. Once on land, Yennefer questioned Nilfgaard's strategy of sacking Cintra and exposing themselves. Vilgefortz explained that the bigger picture was often left for history. Their task was much clearer - hold Sodden and save the continent.
<p>Yennefer, Tissaia, Triss, Vilgefortz, Vanielle, Coral, and Sabrina arrived at the keep, the only thing separating Nilfgaard from the North. They were greeted by a man. Yennefer advised him to take the children and hide, but as he explained, there was no more hiding from Nilfgaard. Their only chance was to fight.
<p>Yennefer recalled Triss spending time in Temeria and asked if she truly believed that King Foltest would bring the Northern armies. Triss trusted that he would come through after she and Geralt helped save his daughter, who was cursed as a striga. Yennefer then sat with Tissaia and discussed Nilfgaard's encroachment and the need to enjoy the night while they could. Yennefer noticed that Tissaia had taken a liking to Vilgefortz. Tissaia looked to her and asked if she was ready to die should they fail to stop Nilfgaard. Yennefer claimed that she was, having lived several lifetimes, none of which satisfied her, Tissaia remarked. Yennefer had accepted that life had no more to give. However, Tissaia argued that Yennefer still had more to give.
<p>Yennefer awakened to find a fireball fired by Nilfgaard coming straight for her. She halted the fireball mid-air and then redirected it. The sun had risen and the Northern mages made it through the night. Unfortunately, Nilfgaard arrived much sooner than they anticipated and the Northern armies were still a ways out. There were only 22 of them left, Yennefer, Tissaia, Triss, Vilgefortz, Vanielle, Coral, Atlan Kerk, and Sabrina included. They watched as a thick fog consumed the mountains around them, signalling Nilfgaard's encroachment. Tissaia ordered Sabrina to take the villagers to the artillery room while she and Triss head down. Yennefer was instructed to keep watch on the tower and reserve her chaos.
<p>Yennefer watched from the tower as Nilfgaard's army approached. She telepathically communicated with the others to alert them and order them to make their move. On Yennefer's command, Vilgefortz portalled to Cahir's destination, taking out half a dozen soldiers before getting to Cahir. During the fight, Vilgefortz was disarmed multiple times, each time using magic to return his sword, despite Yennefer's warnings to reserve his chaos. Vilgefortz was bested by Cahir and with his chaos depleted, Cahir kicks him off the hill. Cahir rolls down the hill and hits his head on a tree stump.
<p>Yennefer watched from the tower as Nilfgaard broke through their forces. She telepathically guided Coral back to the keep. After watching Atlan get struck down by an arrow, Coral decided to stop running. She tried to perform a spell but was killed before she can. Atlan was killed as well.
<p>Sabrina sneaked up behind Yennefer and stabbed her in the abdomen with an arrow after being infected by a parasite. Two young boys, also under the control of the parasites, took their bottles of blue meteorite and dropped them on the table filled with blue meteorite, causing a massive explosion on both ends of the keep that sent Yennefer and Sabrina flying off the tower, though the former managed to stick the landing. The fall appeared to return Sabrina to her normal self as she apologized for attacking Yennefer.
<p>Yennefer limped out of the keep, forced to witness the massacre that had unfolded as villagers of all ages lay dead on the grounds of Sodden Hill. She telepathically called out to her fellow mages without response, telling them to hold the front line as more Nilfgaardians approached. Although Triss seemed to survive the initial attack, she was still too wounded to battle. Yennefer killed two of them as they were tying an arm-less Coral to a tree. Fringilla intercepted Yennefer's message. She told Yennefer to stop fighting and join Nilfgaard. However, Yennefer stayed true to her belief.
<p>Yennefer found Tissaia on the hillside. Tissaia had been severely weakened, but with the Northern armies close, Yennefer refused to give up. She looked Tissaia in the eyes and for the first time, admitted that Tissaia saved her. It was now Yennefer's turn to save the continent. Tissaia urged her to let her chaos explode. Yennefer got back to her feet, absorbed the fire that was consuming the keep and unleashed it all on the Nilfgaard army.

<div id="bio"><p>&#9642; Joe is muslim but one that doesn’t stick strictly to it. As it is a very personal religion he’s made it something that fits him and the life he lives. He makes a point to do morning and evening prayers whenever he can but he won’t punish himself if he’s unable to.
<p>&#9642; He’s a scion, a descendant of a wealthy merchant trading family and it’s why he knows more than just arabic
<p>&#9642; Joe can speak Persian, Arabic, Italian and English.
<p>&#9642; His combat style is swordsman tahtib. It is a traditional stick-fighting martial art. It originated in Egypt and evolved into an egyptian folk dance with a wooden stick.
<p>&#9642; While he does carry a sword, he is also comfortable with modern day weapons including pistols and rifles. 
<p>&#9642; At heart, Joe is a scholar and an artist. He’s only a soldier because he had no real choice. While he was a merchant he was dragged into fighting during the Crusades because of the horrors that were being inflicted on the world he lived in. if it hadn’t been for that he would’ve been content in the life he’d had
<p>&#9642; <b>He is not a crusader.</b> He was a merchant. His lifelong partner, Nicky, was a crusader. Joe was not. They met because of the fighting. And the fact that neither of them could die. After killing each other day after day for a week, if not longer, they came to terms. It was only the centuries they spent together that had them going from enemies to lovers to soulmates.

<div id="hc"><p>&#9642; <b>sweet vs savoury:</b> When it comes to food, Joe is the sort who prefers savoury over something sweet. Growing up in the Maghreb he was exposed to more savoury spices than sweet. Also, in the 11th century refined sugar wasn't a thing nor was sugar readily available like it is in modern times. Everything he ate would've been savoury and would've included spices like saffron, nutmeg, cinnamon, paprika, cloves, cumin, cayenne pepper, aniseed and black pepper. There were the occasional sweet things like oranges and figs, maybe even dates but they weren't what you would typically consider sweet. They were additions to the meal and to add some flavour to the rich meals that would've been his life. Even during his life with Andrew Underhill, their meals were more savoury than sweet, taking advantage of the local culture wherever they were stationed. 
<p>There are some exceptions, of course, and one of those just happened to be macarons. The sweets were created in the Renaissance and were things that Nicky introduced him to during their travels. It was something that quickly became a thing that Joe loved and would seek out whenever they were in a city with a bakery that provided international treats.. When they started to have buttercream, jam or ganache sandwiched between in the them in the 1930s he knew that he was in love with the sandwich treats. He has no particular favourite when it comes to flavours, but he does secretly enjoy coconut, orange and other fruit flavours, and will never turn them down should they be offered. Unfortunately, they also tend to be used as blackmail, mostly by Nicky, because of his weakness for them.

It was a name that he’d used only once, during one of his times in Africa and the life that followed. After losing Nicolò far too soon, he spent that time in mourning travelling the world and occasionally working with Andy and Booker. It was painful for him to be with them as it was a reminder of the times when he and Nicky would work together. But Africa was one of the times when he worked on his own and when he met one Andrew Underhill. It was the last thing he expected and he fell hard for him. After Kinshasa they had several postings and while life in the shadow world was different, it was the sort of thing he needed. Travelling from post to post he knew it wouldn’t last forever. In time they would notice Andrew growing old while he didn’t. Joe knew eventually he’d have to leave. He just never thought it would be as it had been. Demons weren’t his favourite way to die but it saved his partner and the Institute. While they never found proof of his death, he had survived the attack and left Giza, rejoining his friends. Only when they went to New York did his past come to haunt him in a way he never expected. this is a <b>single ship</b> verse with <b>affcgato</b><br /><br />

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>early life</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Armitage Hux was born on the planet Arkanis around the time of the Battle of Yavin, approximately 0 ABY, during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Hux was fathered by Commandant Brendol Hux, though not with his father's wife Maratelle, but rather a kitchen woman, making Hux the commandant's bastard son. As a youngling, Hux was the subject of gossip among the Imperial officers' ranks, as they whispered among themselves about the existence of Brendol's bastard and the mother who bore him.
<p>Brendol made no secret of the low opinion he had about his son, whom he regarded as a frail, weak-willed boy, though not entirely bereft of potential. Grand Admiral Rae Sloane suspected that Hux was regularly abused by his father, both psychologically and physically. Nevertheless, because of his Imperial heritage Hux developed notions of grandeur and believed that he had a right to sit on the throne that ruled the galaxy.
<p>The young Hux became acquainted with his father's fellow officers, such as Enric Pryde, who was a friend of both Brendol and Maratelle, and Admiral Brooks, who openly ridiculed Hux's illegitimacy. Brooks once mocked Hux after he accidentally dropped their refreshments, suggesting that the illegitimate son of a kitchen woman should at least be capable of serving drinks. As Brendol expressed his contempt for his son, calling him pathetic and utterly useless, Hux promised to clean the mess, to which Brooks suggested that he lick the floor. Hux looked to his father for help before acquiescing to the admiral's request. Brendol, however, watched Armitage with disgust and began to physically accost his son.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>fall of the galactic empire</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>The Empire was in its death throes as a result of the Rebel victory at Endor. As the New Republic laid siege to Arkanis, the Hux family was forced to evacuate their homeworld in 5 ABY. Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, a political protégé of the late Emperor Palpatine, became invested in the future of Brendol Hux because of the commandant's visionary ideas on stormtrooper training. At Rax's request, Sloane enlisted the services of the bounty hunter Mercurial Swift to rescue the Huxes, ensuring that neither Brendol nor his son became prisoners of the New Republic.
<p>Unbeknownst to Sloane, Rax was fulfilling the Emperor's Contingency—a clandestine operation designed to destroy the Empire from within and ensure its rebirth in the Unknown Regions of galactic space. Following the Attack on Chandrila, Armitage and Brendol traveled to the planet Jakku, where remnants of the Imperial Military gathered to make a last stand. In the months prior to the Battle of Jakku, the Huxes remained close at Rax's side, who effectively led the Imperial show government as the self-styled Counselor to the Empire. Hux tried to keep his distance from his father, who continued mistreating him, while Brendol trained twenty-four local orphans. By the end of their training, these child soldiers became Counselor Rax's personal bodyguards.
<p>When the New Republic military invaded Jakku, a transport ferried Hux, his father, Counselor Rax, the Emperor's adviser Yupe Tashu, and the child soldiers to the Jakku Observatory—a secret facility in the Plaintive Hand plateau, which was instrumental to the late Emperor's contingency plans. Rax intended to detonate Jakku's planetary core, wiping out both the New Republic and the Empire in a single stroke, before taking Hux and Brendol to the Unknown Regions where they could create a new Empire. As they traveled to the observatory, Hux found himself alone in the transport hold with the child soldiers. The older children intimidated him, as they had been trained by his father to become ruthless killers. Until then, Rax was focused on what Brendol offered to the new Empire that he intended to build in the old regime's place. However, in pitying the boy, who was well aware of what his father thought about him, the Counselor began considering Hux's role as well.
<p>The child soldiers were ultimately gifted to Hux by Counselor Rax, realizing that Hux would carry on his father's work by training a new generation of soldiers bred for warfare. With that, Rax addressed his troops personally, informing them that they would follow Hux's orders to the death and without question. Putting his new authority to the test, Hux ordered one of the boys to strike his comrade. After reaching the observatory, the Huxes were bidden by the Counselor to board his luxury yacht—a replica of the Emperor's Imperialis. Rax, however, was killed by Sloane before he could complete his plan to explode Jakku. Seizing the opportunity to mold the next Empire according to her ideals, Sloane accompanied Hux and Brendol on their sojourn to uncharted space.
<p>During the journey, Sloane befriended Hux, who came to see the Grand Admiral as his protector from Brendol. Hux likewise protected Sloane from the child soldiers, who remained loyal only to himself in accordance with Rax's last wishes. Sloane berated Brendol, warning the commandant to cease hurting his son. However, she also wanted Hux to benefit from his father's experience and as such Brendol was ordered to educate his illegitimate son as he would a proper heir. For several months, the Imperialis traveled through the Unknown Regions, and in that time, Hux and his soldiers grew even more vicious under Brendol's tutelage. Even Sloane was taken aback by Hux's cruelty, which she considered to be an unusual trait for such a small boy. Their travails eventually culminated in their discovery of the Emperor's Super Star Destroyer, the Eclipse.

<center><h3>rise of the first order</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Although the Empire ultimately surrendered to the New Republic, signing the Galactic Concordance that ended the Galactic Civil War, the principles of the New Order survived through a new generation of adherents. Armitage Hux was part of that generation, having grown up listening to stories about legendary Imperial leaders. As part of his education, Hux was raised to believe that the Empire delivered the galaxy from the chaos of the Clone Wars, whereas the New Republic lacked the strength to impose such order.
<p>At the same time, several individual elements of the Old Empire were combined to form a new regime, melding the Empire's political, military and spiritual survivors under a movement that became known as the First Order. As the son of an Imperial Academy commandant, Hux belonged to the military branch that was the template of the First Order military. Like his father, Hux also achieved the military rank of general, becoming a highly placed First Order officer as well as a member of First Order High Command.
<p>Having spent his life in thrall to the idea of Imperial power, General Hux continued his father's legacy which included Brendol's radical ideas on training soldiers from birth. This approach produced a new generation of stormtroopers that began with Brendol and continued through Hux, who also revived another Imperial ideal—achieving military superiority through technological terror.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>the end of brendol hux</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Over the course of his rise to power, the young general ruthlessly dispatched many enemies and potential foes before they became too dangerous a threat. This included the quiet elimination of Hux's father, Brendol, the elder General Hux. Knowing how his father truly felt about him, Hux resolved to kill his father, although this was not the only reason behind his patricidal actions. Driven by ambition and a sense of destiny, he saw Brendol as an obstacle in his path to gaining greater power. To that end, he enlisted the help of Captain Phasma, and the two conspirators agreed that the old Imperial veteran had to be permanently removed so as to promote their own interests.
<p>Although Hux had no reservations about committing patricide, he left the actual killing to his co-conspirator, whom he instructed to use an untraceable method, not wanting the murder to be traced back to himself. Phasma therefore utilized a toxin, taken from the bite of a Parnassos beetle, to assassinate Brendol. Once the deed was done, Hux proceeded with formalities by addressing the members of the First Order Stormtrooper Corps, informing them that their founder had died. After concluding his speech, Hux wasted no time in positioning himself as his father's successor, and even took possession of Brendol's suite on the Absolution.
<p>In the years following Brendol's demise, Hux remodeled the First Order army according to his design, promoting Phasma to complete the older stormtrooper cadets' training. Her methods emphasized loyalty, obedience and ruthlessness, qualities that met with Armitage's approval. Keeping with his habit of eliminating potential threats, Hux sidelined Captain Cardinal, knowing that the latter was a loyal supporter of the general's late father. Cardinal eventually concluded that Phasma was the culprit behind his mentor's death, though he was unaware of Hux's role in it. He reported his findings to Hux, who revealed his own involvement in the conspiracy that assassinated his father. Though Cardinal was ultimately deferential to Hux due to the latter's authority, Hux remained skeptical about Cardinal's loyalty and expected Phasma to elminate him as well.
<p>As a precaution, Hux excluded Cardinal from a meeting of senior First Order officials. When Cardinal arrived with evidence of Phasma's crimes, Hux curtly dismissed the captain, telling him that his services were no longer required. Having spent a lifetime following protocol, Cardinal complied but later attempted to avenge Brendol by killing Phasma. However, he was bested by his fellow captain in single combat and grievously wounded. Cardinal only escaped with the help of Moradi. In the end, his idealized view of the First Order was shattered by the actions of Hux and Phasma.

<center><h3>commander of starkiller</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Thirty years after the Battle of Endor, Hux was the general who commanded Starkiller Base, the primary base of operations of the First Order, as well as the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer and answered to Supreme Leader Snoke. Deeming Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi, to be a threat to the First Order, Hux, along with Ren, were given the directive. Though the First Order possessed maps from the Empire that would lead them to the planet where Skywalker was hiding, they lacked a final piece. To that end, the Finalizer traveled to Jakku and dispatched a group of stormtroopers to attack the settlement of Tuanul, where Ren captured a Resistance pilot named Poe Dameron, who already acquired and hid the final piece of the map. After Ren interrogated Dameron, he informed Hux that the prisoner had entrusted the map to a BB-8 unit. Hux dispatched stormtroopers back to Jakku to search for it and posted a bounty on the droid.
<p>Subsequently, Dameron was freed by a stormtrooper and the pair attempted to escape on a TIE/sf space superiority fighter, disabling the Finalizer's turbolasers. Hux ordered the ventral cannons to shoot down the fighter, causing it to crash-land on Jakku. Upon informing Ren of the incident, the dark knight deduced that the traitorous stormtrooper was FN-2187. Hux checked with Phasma, who noted that this was FN-2187's first offense.
<p>Subsequently, Supreme Leader Snoke ordered BB-8 captured or destroyed if necessary. When Hux informed Ren, the latter questioned the competency of their stormtroopers, given that one of them committed high treason, and suggested that the First Order instead appropriate a clone army like the Galactic Republic and early Empire before them. Hux assured him that his stormtroopers were trained from birth to succeed and reminded Ren not to let his obsession with Skywalker interfere with their mission.

<center><h3>end of the new republic</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>After BB-8 fled Jakku aboard the Millennium Falcon, Hux and Ren returned to Starkiller Base, where they spoke to a hologram of Supreme Leader Snoke. Snoke was not surprised that they let the droid slip through their fingers and stated that the Jedi would rise again if the map got to the Resistance. Hux humbly took full responsibility for his failure, but the Supreme Leader interrupted him, declaring that their strategy had to change. Hux suggested testing the superweapon and destroy the New Republic for supporting the Resistance, leaving their enemies vulnerable. After receiving authorization for the undertaking, Hux then assembled the First Order army at Starkiller Base and gave a grand speech, proclaiming that the destruction of the Republic would be the beginning of the First Order's rise to power in the galaxy. Hux sent his speech via hologram to the First Order's garrison at the Colossus station on Castilon. At his signal, the Starkiller weapon fired and destroyed the Hosnian system, which at the time hosted the Republic's capital and Senate, wiping away its leadership and fleet.
<p>Subsequently, the First Order received a tip from an informant on Takodana that BB-8 was there, so Ren led an attack squadron. However, Ren instead captured BB-8's accomplice, the Jakku scavenger Rey, because she had seen the map, and ordered the division to retreat as the Resistance engaged them. Ren brought Rey back to Starkiller Base and attempted to extract the map from her mind, only to learn that the girl was strong in the Force and turned his own mind probe against him. Hux later walked in a conversation between Ren and Snoke, the latter asking what happened to BB-8. The general humiliated his colleague by telling the Supreme Leader that Ren decided the droid was no longer valuable to the First Order's mission, and that the girl was all they needed. He then informed Snoke that they tracked the Resistance scout ship performing recon on Starkiller Base back to the Ileenium system. Snoke ordered Hux to use the superweapon to destroy the Resistance before they could find Skywalker.
<p>However, while its weapon was charging up, the Resistance led a starfighter assault against Starkiller Base, which resulted in the base's oncoming collapse before it could fire on D'Qar. Hux was then ordered by Snoke to evacuate the planet and to take the defeated Kylo Ren with him, something that Hux, having a very low opinion of Ren, was all too eager to accomplish knowing that Ren suffered a humiliating defeat.
<p>As he was making his way out of the base, Hux's path took him into proximity with the quarters of the Jerjerrod couple, which had been hit by falling debris from a crashed TIE fighter. There, he briefly witnessed the ongoing fight between First Order forces and members of the Resistance's J-Squadron. Officer Jul Jerjerrod requested aid from him, which Hux affirmed, assigning several of his accompanying stormtrooper detachment to aid in the capture of the squadron.

<center><h3>a new galactic war</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>After the Assault on Starkiller Base, Hux led a First Order fleet, including a Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought, to the evacuated main Resistance base on D'Qar. He was, however, briefly distracted by an insulting transmission from Poe Dameron, who repeatedly referred to Hux by the mocking term "General Hugs" and implied that Leia wanted to send a message about Hux's mother. Hux responded that he would not negotiate with the Resistance, but Poe responded as if he couldn't hear him. After a few more attempts which made Hux increasingly angry, he ultimately ordered the dreadnought to destroy the Resistance base, and afterwards, the main fleet. When Resistance bombers came to destroy the Dreadnought, Hux quickly dispatched all but one bomber, which promptly blew up the dreadnought and bought time for the Resistance to escape. However, Hux had a plan to track the Resistance ship through hyperspace, which he presented to Supreme Leader Snoke on his command ship, the Mega-class Star Dreadnought Supremacy.
<p>During the assault on the Resistance fleet, Hux ordered the Star Destroyers to keep at a distance and continue firing at the Resistance flagship Raddus. After the Resistance's medical frigate ran out of fuel, Hux ordered it destroyed the second it was in range, though the ship was successfully evacuated prior to its destruction.
<p>When Finn and Rose Tico were captured while trying to disable the tracker on the Supremacy, they were led to an assembly area of stormtroopers in the hangar, led by General Hux. Hux then struck Finn on the cheek, showing his disdain for him. After insulting the people of the Otomok system, Tico's home system, she bit Hux on the hand. Shortly after, Hux left the pair to be executed by Captain Phasma, having figured out the Resistance's plan to escape via thirty U-55 orbital loadlifters, thanks to DJ divulging this information to the First Order. He also proceeded to have the fleet pick off any and all escape ships one by one. Focused on the annihilation of the transports, Hux brushed off the news that the Raddus was preparing a hyperspace jump as a failed ploy to distract them, unaware that Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo was intending to jump the Raddus to lightspeed directly at the Supremacy. Upon seeing she had turned about face, Hux frantically ordered all firepower concentrated on the Raddus, but it was too late. The faster-than-lightspeed collision sliced the Supremacy in two, also annihilating twenty other Resurgent-class Star Destroyers as well.
<p>After Holdo's suicide attack, General Hux went to the throne room, where during the battle Kylo Ren had killed Snoke. Discovering an unconscious Kylo Ren near the body of the Supreme Leader, Hux tried to take advantage of the situation to kill his rival but Ren woke up before he could act. After he expressed disbelief at seeing Snoke's dead body, Kylo told him that Rey killed Snoke and ordered him to move the men to Crait, to crush the Resistance once and for all. Hux protested, stating than Ren had no rights to command him or his men but Kylo Force-choked Hux until he acknowledged him as the new Supreme Leader.
<p>A period of confusion and uncertainty ensued as word of Supreme Leader Snoke's death spread through the ranks of the First Order. A group of First Order officers discussed among themselves the ramifications of their ruler's demise, and wondered if General Hux had taken the reins of power as the First Order's new Supreme Leader.
<p>Under the new Supreme Leader's reign, Hux traveled to the First Order supertanker, the Titan, to meet with Commander Pyre and Agent Tierny. While on the station, he and his stormtrooper attache ordered Kazuda Xiono, who was disguised as a First Order technician, to lead him to the briefing room of the station. Upon arriving to the briefing area, Hux delivered more orders to Pyre regarding the attainment of valuable supertanker assets, notably to quell the resistance on the Colossus. During the later meeting, Hux became frustrated with the interruption to the meeting caused by Xiono's theft of the Titan's radiation deflector.
<p>Eventually, Hux destroyed the planet of Tah'Nuhna because of its assistance to the Resistance, despite pleading from its leaders. At the order of Kylo Ren, Hux also ordered the Kendoh Gang to get Resistance operative Finn when they alerted him that they'd spotted him, though Hux had initially refuted the validity of the gang's claims.
<p>Hux was eventually contacted by Chadkol Gee regarding the Resistance presence on Mon Cala. Upon arriving to Mon Cala, Hux ordered the destruction of rebellious Quarren and Mon Calamari fighters. Following the skirmish, Hux deduced that Mon Cala had finally sided with the Resistance.
<p>In the aftermath of the devastation of Aeos Prime, Hux was informed via holoprojector by Commander Pyre and Agent Tierny that the suppression of the Aeos system was complete and that there was no longer any Resistance presence in the sector. Hux then walked away so Supreme Leader Kylo Ren could talk with Pyre and Tierny about the matter of the Colossus.
<p>Hux, alongside Supreme Leader Ren, was in command of a Resurgent-class Star Destroyer that captured a Resistance Intersystem Transport Ship. However, Poe Dameron managed to escape before returning with a sizeable fleet that caught the First Order off-guard.

<center><h3>at wars end</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>In the year after the Battle at Crait, a mysterious message swept out across the galaxy in the voice of Darth Sidious, previously presumed dead at Endor decades prior. In actuality, his spirit had in some manner endured, and through the power and influence of his station as Emperor and as a Sith Lord, he had assembled a shadow empire on the fringes of the galaxy. With the aid of loyal servants on the hidden planet of Exegol, Sidious had forged one of the largest fleets in history, crewed by Sith troopers. Following an initial meeting with a hostile Kylo Ren, the Emperor persuaded the apprentice of Snoke to unite their forces under the common banner of the Final Order and usher in ultimate galactic dominance.
<p>In parallel to these events, Hux's triumphant First Order military had been tasked by Ren with destroying the remaining Resistance forces, which had continued fighting after Crait but had largely been forced underground by the repressive and expanding regime. In the course of these operations, a number of TIE fighters became involved in a pursuit of the Millennium Falcon as it collected intelligence from Boolio on a spy embedded deep within the First Order that could lead the Resistance to the resurgent Sidious.
<p>Shortly after the TIEs had chased the Falcon from the Sinta Glacier Colony, the Supreme Leader and his Knights of Ren arrived and captured Boolio, interrogating and ultimately killing the alien before delivering his decapitated head to a conference of the First Order High Command, including Allegiant General Enric Pryde and Hux, who had become rivals in the year after Crait. Ren informed his subordinates that there was a traitor in their midst. Sensing apprehension among them, the Supreme Leader inquired if his freshly reassembled helmet made Hux uncomfortable; the general quietly replied that it did not. A comment from General Bellava Parnadee that she liked the mask brought a short pause to the proceedings.
<p>General Domaric Quinn spoke up, positing that the returned Sidious and his followers seemed more like a cult than anything else. Pryde dismissed this concern, but Quinn continued, wondering aloud if the fleet promised by the Sith Lord was a gift and what he might demand in return. Enraged, Ren used the Force to choke General Quinn and throw his body to the ceiling, announcing to the remaining assembly that his mission, and that of the First Order, were to eliminate Rey, as the Emperor had commanded.
<p>Following a brief skirmish between First Order troops and Rey's Resistance party on Pasaana, Hux presented to Pryde a "valuable prisoner" taken during the fighting: Chewbacca, who is believed dead by his allies. The elder commander, unfazed by the roaring of the Wookiee, ordered immediate interrogation. Shortly after, Ren would return to the Steadfast, having failed to accomplish the task set by Sidious.
<p>The Steadfast eventually arrived at Kijimi shortly after the arrival of Rey's party, with Ren swiftly disembarking to aid his knights in hunting the scavenger and her allies. Through an old accomplice of Dameron, the fugitives were able to sneak aboard the vessel in order to liberate Chewbacca from First Order custody, Rey having discovered his survival through the Force. Although they managed to kill a number of stormtroopers, all members of the strike team save for Rey were eventually swarmed by overwhelming numbers and captured. Hux soon arrived to confront the prisoners and ordered their immediate execution. He chose to accompany the squad of troopers selected for the duty as they escorted Finn, Dameron and Chewbacca to a sequestered section of the ship.
<p>Moments before the sentence was to be carried out, Hux spoke up and claimed that he would like to join the firing squad. Accepting the blaster of one of the troopers present, the general swiftly spun around and killed the troopers before outing himself as the spy that Ren and Pryde had been hunting within their ranks. Offering his assistance to the bewildered Resistance agents, he quickly escorted them to the incarcerated Falcon, lingering behind them as they blasted their way through his own troops.
<p>Stopping Finn before he could board the Falcon, Hux demanded that the former stormtrooper shoot him in the arm in order to verify his cover story that he had been forced to aid in their escape. Out of spite, Finn shot the general in the thigh. He then inquired as to why Hux would betray the First Order he had helped build; disdainfully, the general said that he didn't care if the Resistance won so much as that Ren needed to lose. The Resistance agents then completed their escape, rejoining Rey as she ended her latest duel with Ren, who had returned to the Steadfast after discovering she was aboard.

<br />

<center><h3>the aftermath</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>After having his wound bandaged, Hux eventually arrived at the bridge of the Steadfast to explain the events that had transpired to an enraged Pryde. He lied, claiming that the prisoners had overpowered him, killed his men and compelled him to aid in their escape. Moments before Pryde pulled the blaster to kill him, Hux ordered those still loyal to him on the bridge to execute Pryde as he was the traitor. Once he was certain that Pryde was dead he had someone inform Ren that their traitor had been taken care of and he immediately took control of the First Order military. Hux had no plans on helping the Emperor. While he is relieved to hear that Ren killed him once and for all, he is still determined to mould the First Order into what it should have been all along. After the battle on Exegol he takes those still loyal to him and retreats to the outer regions of space so they could regroup and repair what’s left of the First Order. In time he plans on exerting their dominance over the galaxy once again.

<center><h3>personality &amp; traits</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>General Armitage Hux is a human male who stands at 1.85 meters and weighs 75 kilograms. He has red hair, green eyes and pale skin due to lack of exposure to sunlight. His favorite beverage is bitter tarine tea. He was a ruthless officer in the First Order as well as an adherent to the ideals of the Galactic Empire. Like other members of his generation, who served as the vanguard of First Order leadership, Hux was strikingly young, but what he lacked in experience and wisdom, he made up for in his zeal. Due to his youth, Hux's experiences in warfare were entirely theoretical. Though acknowledged for the thoroughness and complexity of his simulations, Hux earned little respect for his abilities as a warrior.
<p>As the son of a highly placed official in the old Imperial Academy, Hux was raised to celebrate his Imperial heritage. He grew up idolizing historical Imperials who became legends in the First Order. Hux was convinced that the Empire delivered the galaxy from the violence of the Clone Wars, and that the galaxy once again needed to be saved from itself. This responsibility fell to the First Order, as the New Republic, in Hux's view, was too weak to prevent the inevitable chaos. Hux felt nothing except contempt for the New Republic, a regime that he regarded as corrupt and illegitimate, and treacherous for secretly supporting the Resistance, another organization that the general loathed.
<p>In addition to his views on the New Republic, Hux did not view the First Order as a continuation of the Old Empire, but rather its successor. Despite his admiration for the Empire's accomplishments and his desire to relive the glories of its past, Hux believed the Empire fell due to internal flaws, whereas he saw the First Order as a more refined and pure version of what the Empire sought to become, but never achieved. This viewpoint led Hux to look down on the older generation of Imperial veterans who founded the First Order. In Hux's mind, officers such as Captain Edrison Peavey belonged to a different time, and had outlived their glory days.
<p>Due to his imperious nature, Hux sought far greater authority than that of his official rank as general. Though his ultimate ambition was to become Supreme Leader, Hux was content to wield authority over both the armies and fleets of the First Order as Grand Marshal while Snoke reigned. Undaunted by Snoke's refusal to grant this title, the young general continued to court the Supreme Leader's favor in order to promote his military career, resulting in his elevation as commander of Starkiller Base. With his ruler's support, Hux proudly took the reigns of the Starkiller project, determined to become the face of the First Order regime. Hux took great care to conceal his ambitions as best he could, having to occasionally stop himself from referring to himself as "Supreme Leader Hux," as he was well aware of the First Order's extensive surveillance system. In addition to the Supreme Leader's title, Hux coveted Snoke's flagship, the Supremacy, and would often transfer his command ship from the Finalizer to the gargantuan Mega-class Star Dreadnought. Hux respected Snoke for building the First Order out of a group of Imperial refugees exiled to the Unknown Regions, but in private he did not consider anyone other than himself as being capable of directing the galaxy's industries and nurturing their innovations, while commanding the citizens' respect.
<p>Hux is obsessed with his appearance; believing it was a vital part for maintaining discipline, he would always wear a parade uniform designed to broadcast his authority as general. Even his posture was affected by this belief, as Hux would often pose in a formal parade stance. In addition to his uniform and bearing, Hux's hair was coiffed to his exacting standards.Hux carried an officers version of the SE-44C with dark plaster as opposed to the regular white sidearm.
<p>Hux had little understanding or patience for the mystical ways of the Force. While he did not doubt the Force's existence, having witnessed its power in action and even experienced it in the form of a punishment, Hux nonetheless regarded it as the center of an obsolete religion belonging to a bygone era. The future, Hux believed, would be ruled through industry and innovation, and as such he regarded himself as a man of science and technology. Notwithstanding his lack of faith in the Force, Hux believed in himself and considered it his destiny to sit on the throne that would rule the galaxy.
<p>A rival of Kylo Ren, Hux hated the Supreme Leader's apprentice, whom he disdainfully referred to as "Snoke's loathsome creature." As they vied for the approval of the Supreme Leader, a tense competition was formed between Hux and Ren, with the latter representing the mystical side of the First Order that Hux cared little for. Despite their mutual contempt for each other, a part of Hux respected Ren and his Force abilities, although Ren had little if anything to say about Hux's fighting skills. Ren regarded Hux as a craven coward, a view reinforced when Hux, on one occasion, turned and fled from a hostile animal, leaving his rival to defend himself while he hid under the cover of tall grass. In loathing Ren, Hux took pleasure in his adversary's failures and Snoke's anger with his apprentice. The fact that Ren required rescuing from Starkiller Base after losing to a lightsaber novice particularly delighted the young general. His hatred for Ren extended to his followers, the Knights of Ren, despising them for their unkempt appearance as well as their tendency to tread dirt into the polished halls of First Order capital ships.
<p>Several separate elements comprised the First Order, and General Hux was firmly part of the military branch. As such, he continued to use the Stormtrooper training regimen pioneered by his father, based on ideas that the elder Hux developed as an Academy commandant. Hux had complete confidence in his father's idea that stormtroopers trained through vivid simulations made the most loyal soldiers. Openly proud to be the inheritor of his father's legacy, Hux refused to stand by while Ren criticized an entire generation of soldiers who had been trained under two generations of the Hux family. Having invested a lifetime in their training, Hux considered his stormtroopers as examples of the perfect warrior—a soldier trained from birth and programmed for absolute loyalty. Though baffled by the treasonous actions of FN-2187, Hux believed that the renegade trooper was an abnormality whose isolated case had no bearing on the reliability of the other stormtroopers that obeyed their orders without question.
<p>Ultimately, Hux was a man of no scruples who craved power above all. He was utterly remorseless, possessing a predisposition to the act of killing that existed within him since early childhood. As he rose to power, Hux dispatched many enemies and would-be foes, including his own father, the elder General Brendol Hux. As the commanding officer of Starkiller Base, the younger Hux was responsible for the deaths of billions. He took pride in the weapon that the First Order had built into a planet, marveling at its destructive power and was certain that the new galactic war would be won with the firing of a single shot. Throughout his career, Hux utilized assassination and sabotage as methods for eliminating his enemies, both within the First Order and without, although he rarely carried out such tactics on his own, preferring to have his allies or subordinates do the work for him. However, Hux made an exception for Admiral Brooks. Having never forgotten the way Brooks treated him as a child, Hux shot the elder officer in the shoulder and proceeded to torture him, ignoring the Brooks' pleas for mercy before finally executing the injured, unarmed man.
<p>Beneath the surface of Hux's pride and ambition existed a burning shame that started with the abuse he endured under his father's care. Though he also enjoyed a life of privilege due to Brendol's elevated position in the early First Order, young Armitage was the object of Brendol's scorn and therefore lived in fear of his father. Brendol considered his son pathetic, weak, sniveling and utterly useless. Hux likewise loathed his father and regarded Brendol as an "old bastard" whose death gave him a sense of relief. Nevertheless, Hux was proud of his ties to the Empire, being the son of an Imperial Academy commandant. However, he was forced to live with the shame of being his father's bastard son by a kitchen woman, rather than a legitimate heir by Brendol's lawful wife, Maratelle. For all of his imperiousness and sense of manifest destiny, Hux never forgot his origins—he was the unloved, illegitimate son of a man who hated him—and he never forgave his abusers. As an adult, Hux possessed a delicate ego that was easily wounded by mockery, such as Poe Dameron's deliberate mispronunciation of his name as "General Hugs."
<p>Vaunting the technological might of Starkiller Base was the last time when Hux felt certain about anything. He watched helplessly as his fortunes changed for the worse, with Ren ascending to the rank of Supreme Leader in the wake of Snoke's unforeseen demise, and Allegiant General Enric Pryde gaining greater favor in the new regime at Hux's expense. His deviousness and years of jockeying for power worked against the general, as the new Supreme Leader considered Hux untrustworthy and entrusted him with nothing of importance. After Ren seized power, Hux lost much of the zeal he possessed under Snoke's reign, despite managing to survive under his rival's rule. By then, Hux no longer aspired to the title of Grand Marshal, as that role had been essentially taken by the Allegiant General.
<p>He continued to observe military protocol, but no longer did so in spirit—and although he was given a seat on the Supreme Council, Hux maintained an uncharacteristically silent presence, being careful not to provoke Ren's temper as he had done in the past. Without Snoke's protection, Hux began addressing Ren with the deference due to the latter's power and rank. In private, however, he strongly disapproved of Ren's leadership of the First Order as well as his handling of the war, and was convinced that Ren had gone mad for diverting his attention from the Resistance to investigate Darth Sidious' return.
<p>Even as he watched his career trajectory veer wildly off course, Hux did not completely abandon his scheming nature. In the end, the general who led the vanguard of the First Order's invasion of the galaxy committed treason by spying for the Resistance. However, he was not motivated by regret for his actions or a newfound belief in the Resistance's cause. Hux was remorseless to the end; all he had left was his rivalry with Ren, whose reign he sought to undermine until it ended in defeat.

<div id="hc"><p>&#9642; <b>millicent the cat:</b> <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/702716947016740865/sWfZKW9H_400x400.jpg">millicent</a> is hux’s ginger and white tabby cat. she happens to be larger than a typical cat but given the fact she is an unknown breed it’s possible she could end up similar to a small dog. should anyone actually visit his quarters or step into his office near the bridge they are likely to see her sleeping off in one corner. she tends to the typical cat who sticks to herself, but she’s been known to be found in ren’s quarters or that of phasma or mitaka. it all depends on her mood and whether or not they have food that she can steal from them.
<p>millicent was found as a <a href="https://www.warrenphotographic.co.uk/photography/bigs/41502-Ginger-Maine-Coon-kitten-rolling-over-white-background.jpg">kitten</a> during a routine shipment of supplies to the finalizer. while hux rarely oversaw each and every shipment that was brought on board, he happened to have been there when one of the troopers noticed they had a stowaway. usually their shipments were nothing out of the ordinary; sometimes munitions, sometimes weapons, most of the time food and other supplies that a ship the size of the finalizer needed. this time it seemed as if they had a stowaway and not wanting to leave it to someone he didn’t trust, hux took it upon himself to deal with their four legged stowaway. even though he was meant to find a way of dealing with her, something about the way she looked at him made it difficult. instead, he set her up in his quarters and tried to do his best to sneak food in for her. it may not have been the best of situations and those he trusted would constantly give him strange looks but he was certain that keeping her around was better than sending her somewhere else or just getting rid of her entirely.
<p>in time hux found himself caring for millicent in ways he didn’t think possible. all of his life he thought he was closed off from feeling anything other than anger and frustration. millicent has open him up to feeling things like love and compassion. hux even finds himself worrying when he can’t find her. while she’s known to mostly spend her time in hux’s quarters or his office, she’s been known to use the air ducts in the ship to travel throughout. she knows the ship as well as anyone else and also knows who is willing to feed her goodies and who will let her sleep in their quarters without disturbing her. sometimes he will walk by ren’s quarters and he knows she’s laying in there without looking. he likes to blame her for the fact that he doesn’t hate kylo ren as much as he used to before she came on board.
<p>at the end of the day, though, millicent will always find her way back to hux’s quarters because that’s home to her and because she knows that hux needs her there to remind him that he doesn’t have to be the hardass he is in public in private.

<br />
<div id="hc"><p>&#9642; <b>drawing &amp; paper:</b> hux loves to create new weapons, new cruisers and new fighters. starkiller base is one of his greatest creations, after all. ideas tend to come to him at the weirdest of times, and when they do come he wants to be able to jot them down so he doesn’t forget them. but what most people don’t know is that all of his images start out as generalised sketches on paper that he keeps either in his office or in his quarters. even though he can use the technology available to him, he finds it relaxing to jot them down on paper so he can see how it could end up.
<p>during his time at the military academy he started to sketch down ideas for imperial ships and weapons when he wasn’t studying for his classes. most of his classmates used the technology available to them and hux did, too, once he was done sketching. but there was something about a pencil and the sound it made over paper that was soothing to him. luckily, he had his own quarters while at the academy and the only time people saw him sketching instead of using the technology were those times he was stuck in the library doing research. each and every time he was given strange looks and some even whispered behind his back. but none of it changed his mind. not even the times his father saw him and reminded him what a waste of time it was for him to draw when he would need to input it into their systems. it never deterred him. if anything it pushed him to keep drawing.
<p>once he was assigned to his first ship, it was a habit he kept up with. though given his rank it was only something he did in the privacy of his quarters. the last thing he needed was some of his fellow officers to think he was either odd or was looking to set himself apart. which he was. his goal was to rise through the ranks until he was the leader of the first order. hux just didn’t want those around him to know that quite yet. while the idea of starkiller started in the academy he polished the idea through his military career until he was able to put it into use under snoke’s command. the weapon looked similar to the idea he first came up with and performed even better. and it’s what pushed him to keep drawing more and more weapons. he also came up with new ideas for tie fighters for the fleet. hux knows that his designs will help propel the first order into the dominance of the galaxy he knows it’s capable of being. and once he’s in a position to do so he will start to institute the changes he sees and put his ideas into production.
</div>
<br />
<div id="hc"><p>&#9642; <b>sex:</b> When it comes to sex, it is nothing more than an act, a release of stress and nothing more. He has no attachments to it, to the person he’s slept with or anything else related to that. Some of it comes from the physical and psychological abuse he went through as a child. A lot of it, though, has to do with the fact that all of his focus is on his career and his advancement.  Hux sees no point in allowing something as trivial as sex to interfere with the plans he’s worked so hard to put into place. All of his drive and his focus is on assuming command and leadership of the First Order. Sex, in his mind, is a messy thing that would interfere with his ambitions and he wants nothing to do with them.
<p>Those rare times when he does indulge in sex he makes certain that his partner understands he is the dominant one in bed. Given the fact that Hux is someone who retains control of every aspect in his life it’s not a surprise that he’s very domineering in bed. He’s not cruel to his partner. Not unless they asked for it. But he does prefer to be efficient. The sooner it’s over the better is his overall opinion. He doesn’t like anything that interrupts the daily routine he’s set for himself and if something does he requires it to be something he can finish within a timely manner and return to the routine he prefers. Fortunately, or unfortunately depending on how you look at it, sex tends to fall into that category.
<p>That’s not to say that he can’t change his routine or his opinion on sex. It would take someone a lot of time and effort to get past everything that he’s put into place. In time, Hux can come to enjoy not only sex but being with someone, or having someone in his life. It won’t be easy and it will require a lot of work, but it is something that’s possible. He won’t admit that. His reputation is one that he has worked too damn hard to have it ruined by someone getting underneath his skin.
</div>
<br />
<div id="hc"><p>&#9642; <b>feelings &amp; attachments:</b> Just like sex, Hux doesn’t allow himself to feel anything for people. Nor does he allow himself to form attachments. Feelings other than anger or frustration make him weak, show those around him that he’s human and can be taken advantage of, and are things he wants nothing to do with. The same as attachments. Anyone who gets too close to him can be used against him to get whatever it is someone wants. Unfortunately, it’s something he’s seen time and time again, and he’s told himself that he would never allow anyone to get that close to him. His end goals are far too important to allow anything get in his way.
<p>It also doesn’t help that he carries a great amount of shame for the things that happened to him as a child. The physical and psychological abuse at the hands of Brendol left a deep scar on him. Allowing someone to getver  close, to see beneath the façade he’s worked so hard to craft would mean someone seeing the broken, damaged man he is. The façade that he shows the world is more of a protection for the shame and guilt he feels than anything else, and attachments mean someone will see behind all of that. And the last thing Hux needs is for someone to feel pity for him.
<p>Feelings also unnerve Hux. He was never shown any sort of kindness as a child; only abuse. In turn this showed him that the only way to deal with people was that same sort of behaviour; cold, callous and unwavering. Should anyone see feelings from him they would wonder what had happened to their leader and why he looked so different. He also feels like feelings would change who he is as a person. Hux is content being a cold hearted sort of man who is focused on his own advancements. He doesn’t need any sort of feelings to remind him he is human underneath all of these layers. In his mind it’s easier to be that robotic soldier who sleeps in his uniform than someone who rolls up his sleeves once he closes the doors to his quarters.

<br />
<div id="hc"><p>&#9642; <b>migraines:</b> Hux has suffered with migraines all of his life. It was something that started while he was at the military academy and it’s continued to follow him through his adult life. During his time at the academy he had a standing order for painkillers so that he wouldn’t have to constantly deal with the pain. Unfortunately, there were times when the drugs he needed were ineffective. Those times Hux tended to isolate himself in his quarters and wait for the migraine to pass. Luckily, those times were few and far between, but they were enough for his father to constantly remind him that he was weak and useless since he couldn’t handle a simple headache.
<p>Once he left the academy and once his father was dead he found that the migraines tapered off until they were negligible. This led him to believe that they were stress based and once the stress was at a manageable level he no longer suffered from them. Hux actually thought they were in his past as they rarely came back while he moved up the ranks in the First Order. Those times that he did he could get something from the medbay and not have to worry about the stronger meds he used to take during his time at the military academy.
<p>All of that changed once Kylo Ren was assigned to his ship. Not only did the stress levels on the ship rise to an intolerable level, but he started to grind his teeth; something he hadn’t done since the very early days at the academy. Each and every day he starts out with a low grade ache in his head that eventually roars to life as a full blown migraine. Once again Hux requires the medications he took while at the academy and most days he asks for something stronger. If he’s going to lead the First Order he needs to be able to handle things without the stress that comes from dealing with Kylo Ren. 
<p>While he’s unable to retreat to his quarters to deal with the pain that comes from them, he does tend to retreat to his office. The quiet and dark tends to help more than anything though there are times when he will try to meditate in the hopes it will ease the pain. Unfortunately, Hux knows the only way to deal with the pain is to lower his stress. And to lower his stress means putting distance between Kylo and himself; something he knows neither one of them can do. Instead, he tries his best to avoid Ren in the hopes it will eventually dissipate. 
</div>
<br />
<div id="hc"><p>&#9642; <b>nicknames:</b> As much as Hux hates the name Armitage, he hates some of the other nicknames he's heard over the years even more. If he'd been given any choice in his name Armitage was the last thing he would've picked for himself. Since it was one his mother gave him he made a point of embracing it even though it lead to plenty of those around him shortening it or using some other nickname.
<p>The most common nickname that he hears is Armie. That one tends to set him off more than anything. It sounds more like a child's name and brings him back to those days when he had to deal with Brendol and his constant disappointment. Anyone who actually uses Armie around him will not only get a glare,  but will see one of the rare times when Hux actually loses control of his temper. Usually someone who calls him that will be threatened with loss of rank, loss of assignments or being stuck with the worst possible assignments. The length depends on how upset he is and sometimes he'll even extend the length of punishment just to prove a point.
<p>The next common nickname that he hears is Tig. While it doesn't set him off nearly as badly as Armie, it's still a nickname that he loathes. In his mind it's lazy and makes him wonder of those who thought of it were incapable of either using his whole name or at least his last name. Those who actually use that nickname will get a glare and then complete silence. It doesn't matter what they wanted from him, he will refuse to acknowledge anything more than their presence should they use that with him. An apology might actually get him to acknowledge them, but for the most part he tends to ignore any who use that particular nickname.
<p>There are some exceptions to this rule but even those will still get a negative reaction. Those he's close with or are in a relationship with won't get the extreme reactions to nicknames that others might. They will most likely get glares and the silent treatment but unlike anyone else, the length of time that he punishes them is significantly shorter if it exists at all.
</div>
<br />
<div id="hc"><p>&#9642; <b>sexuality:</b> When it comes to Hux's sexuality he finds himself in flux. He tends to be someone who is not only aroflux but aceflux, as well.. Some days he could be towards the demi end of the scale, while other days he can be towards the gray end of the scale. It's hard for him to pinpoint exactly what he is. Just that he knows what he feels and knows that it's the sort of person he is. Sex is one of the things he struggles with. In all honesty, he's the sort who doesn't NEED sex to survive or to go about his day. Even though he's willing to have what most people consider one nights stands, in his mind that isn't actually sex. To him it's just another act like sparring or jogging or anything that people do to let off steam. Sex to him is done with someone he has a deep connection with, someone he feels might actually respect his desires in life and not hold him back. Unfortunately, because he tends to keep everyone at arms length he doesn't have to worry about finding anyone that he might have a connection with. It also doesn't help that his focus is on the First Order. Hux doesn't need nor want anyone that might distract him from that. It's actually quite the vicious cycle but one that has been his life since he realised just who and what he was. For anyone who wants to get close to him they have to share similar goals and they need to have some amount of patience otherwise Hux will shove them away like he does everything else in his life.

His death came at the hands of a Roman Soldier and having been found by Andromache accepted his new life as an immortal. It hadn’t been easy but given the amount of wars that showed up, he knew that his life would be content. Throughout the ages Cadeyrn found himself in battle after battle, unable to resist the urge and much to Andromache’s chagrin. The more time he spent with her, though, the more he found their work fulfilling. Much more than a battle ever would.

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>early life</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Two years prior to his birth, Poe Dameron's voice was heard by Padawan Ezra Bridger during his mission to a realm between time and space. Born in 2 ABY, Poe Dameron was the son of Shara Bey and Kes Dameron, who both served the Alliance to Restore the Republic in the fight against the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. As an infant, Dameron rarely saw his parents due to the Alliance's continued operations against the Imperials before and after the Battle of Endor, as his mother worked as a Rebel pilot for the Alliance's Green Squadron and his father was a member of the Pathfinders, and Dameron was thus left in the care of his maternal grandfather. Six months after the Battle of Endor, after the Imperial remnant put forward Operation: Cinder, Poe Dameron's parents left Rebel service to reunite with him, settle on Yavin 4 and build a house in a colony—close to which they planted a Force-sensitive tree, a gift from Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker.
<p>At age 6, Poe Dameron began to learn how to fly in his mother's old RZ-1 A-wing interceptor, which was part of his mother's compensation package when she mustered out of the Rebellion. She would take Dameron up in it, and he would sit in her lap, learning how to control the ship from her. Tragedy struck his family when his mother unexpectedly died; at the time, Dameron was only eight years old. L'ulo L'ampar, Bey's fellow Rebel pilot and friend, helped raise Dameron, and was thus like family to him.
<p>In 18 ABY, Dameron became a member of the Spice Runners of Kijimi, during which time he cultivated a relationship with Zorii Bliss. However, he ultimately left the group.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>serving the republic</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Eventually, Poe Dameron became a pilot himself and joined the New Republic Defense Fleet. Upon entering the New Republic's service, he would be trained by legendary pilot and Rebel veteran, Wedge Antilles and was considered to be one of Antilles' best students. Poe also began to learn the true scope of his mother's heroism, and he himself rose through the ranks, becoming a commander for the New Republic, and earned the reputation of being extremely skilled.
<p>Poe would be given command of Rapier Squadron, a group of T-85 X-wings, Dameron also met the spherical astromech droid BB-8, who would go onto assist him during his flights as Rapier Leader and become a steadfast friend from then on.
<p>At one point in his Navy career, Rapier Squadron was deployed to Brooksdion space station, where Dameron declared that he was "owned by the stars". They then received a scramble alert to chase down a starship whose occupants had just stolen the head of a droid assigned to an admiral. They gave chase in their X-wings, but it fled into the Lost Souls asteroid field. Dameron ordered his wingmen to hold, but he continued the chase.
<p>His squadron was stationed at the Mirrin Prime Republic base, under Major Lonno Deso. In time, Dameron came to be aware of the threat the First Order represented and the leeway they were given by the Republic, but he and his squadron were merely deployed to patrol trade lanes in the Mirrin sector and protect ships from piracy.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>pilot of the resistance</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>After a skirmish involving the First Order, Leia Organa realized that Dameron reminded her of her brother Luke Skywalker—for being passionate, an outstanding pilot and dedicated to doing what was right—and offered him the opportunity to join the Resistance in its conflict against the First Order. Dameron immediately accepted, as did Kun and Arana. Retaining the rank of commander and now in charge of his own fighter wing, Dameron was transferred to the Echo of Hope, and in the next few months, he went onto helping in recruiting efforts to find additional pilots, scouting missions, long-range reconnaissance, and searching for signs of First Order movement and positions.
<p>In his service to the Resistance, Dameron became one of Organa's most-trusted operatives,[20] and quickly rose through the ranks of the understaffed Starfighter Corps, earning the command of both Red and Blue Squadron―the latter of which served as the primary line of defense for the Resistance base on D'Qar. Under the callsign of Black Leader, to denote his customized, dark-hulled T-70 X-wing starfighter Black One, Dameron was assisted during his flights by BB-8.
<p>A few months after his adventures with Kazuda, Poe picked up BB-8, and at Organa's behest, both went to Tuanul on Jakku to retrieve a map to Skywalker's location from Lor San Tekka, but during the meeting, stormtroopers under the command of Kylo Ren attacked the village. Alerted by BB-8 of their arrival, Dameron and the droid attempted to flee in their X-wing starfighter, but a pair of stormtroopers disabled the engines. Left with no alternative, Dameron gave the map to BB-8 and ordered the astromech to flee, while he remained behind to cover BB-8's escape. After watching the confrontation between Tekka and Ren, Dameron tried to take a shot at Ren, but he caught the blaster bolt in mid-air and immobilized Dameron simultaneously with the Force. Dameron was subsequently taken prisoner, while the rest of the villagers were slaughtered.
<p>Taken aboard the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer, Dameron resisted interrogation until Ren assaulted him with the Force, which eventually caused Dameron to crack about BB-8. Left alone by Ren, a renegade stormtrooper named FN-2187 helped Dameron escape. Together, they stole a TIE/sf space superiority fighter from a hangar bay, with FN-2187 manning the guns while Dameron piloted the fighter, and managed to disable the Finalizer's turbolasers. Upon a disagreement—while FN-2187 wanted to flee the system, Dameron attempted to return to Jakku to retrieve BB-8 and the map—, their TIE fighter was disabled on General Armitage Hux's orders, the blast knocking Dameron out.
<p>Whereas FN-2187, dubbed "Finn" by Dameron, ejected from the TIE shortly before it crashed on the planet's surface, Dameron was unable to eject due to his jacket getting caught in the ejector mechanism. With no time left to eject, Dameron piloted the craft as skillfully as he could to a crash landing which threw him clear of the the crash, his jacket falling in another direction. Suffering from a concussion and a brief period of memory loss, he moved away from the crash. When he awoke, Dameron found himself alone and set off to find a ship and contact the Resistance, sure that he would be able to reunite with BB-8 with their help. During his journey, he encountered a Jakku native, the Blarina Naka Iit, whom Dameron managed to impress with both his sheer audacity and his piloting skills, such that he agreed to get Dameron to a ship in Blowback Town that would get him back to the Resistance. Dameron hitched a ride from Iit's friend, Ohn Gos to Yavin 4, where he left Black One prior to his mission to Jakku.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>first order &mdash; resistance war</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Following the destruction of the Hosnian system, Dameron was deployed to lead a squadron of Resistance X-Wing fighters to fend off the First Order garrison attacking Maz Kanata's castle on Takodana. Dameron, piloting the Black One, swooped in dangerously low, attacking at treetop level, and took out parked TIE fighters, clusters of troopers, and support vehicles, firing repeatedly without wasting a single energy burst. The battle ended prematurely when Ren ordered his troops to retreat once he had captured Rey, a scavenger who had seen the map to Skywalker's location.
<p>After returning to base, Dameron was reunited with BB-8 and Finn, who offered to return his jacket. Dameron declined, stating that his jacket suited Finn better. Subsequently, the ex-trooper requested Dameron's help in rescuing his friend Rey, by asking Dameron to take him to meet General Organa. Together, they made it to the conference room, where Finn disclosed what he knew of the First Order superweapon, Starkiller Base. After a reconnaissance flight by Wexley, the Resistance command made the plans to attack the base, assigning Dameron to lead the starfighter attack to the weapon's thermal oscillator.
<p>After the successful attack on Starkiller Base, the Resistance lowered their guard on their base at D'Qar, having initially come to believe that they weren't going to live another day. However, as they resumed their activities, C-3PO called General Organa and the other Resistance members to inform them that the First Order Navy was regrouping to attack them in retaliation, resulting in Organa ordering Threepio to give the order to evacuate the planet. Concluding that they would not be able to leave the planet before the attack, Dameron proposed a pretty simple distraction idea, which Organa agreed to listen: he would pilot the Black One and hold the First Order's fleet long enough to give them time for evacuating, considering that the First Order commanders had planet-sized egos would lead them to compete to take him out.
<p>Though Admiral Ushos O. Statura informed Dameron that he wasn't going to survive such a maneuver, Dameron replied that he would be a tiny target for the Star Destroyers' large weaponry that would never hit him, assuring that he could even fly close to the Destroyers so to make them cause damage between each other. Convinced that Dameron's tactic would serve, Organa approved his plan and wished the Force would be with him. Before departing, Pava told him that his idea was terrible, as the Black One had an experimental booster. At that moment, Snap, Tallie Lintra, Suralinda Javos appeared on scene and Wexley told Dameron that in case he was blown up, they would help to finish the mission, including Pava, telling him that this was a mission for the whole Black Squadron despite Dameron saying that their assistance wasn't part of the plan. However, General Organa came and dismissed their assistance, telling Captain Wexley that she needed them to reach out to their New Republic allies and gather help before Snoke consolidated his power across the galaxy.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>demotion, mutiny &amp; crait</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Shortly after giving Armitage Hux a message about his mother, Dameron eliminated the surface cannons onboard the Fulminatrix, paving the way for Cobalt Squadron to bomb the dreadnought. However, his overconfidence to destroy it overcame him, resulting in the destruction of the squadron, turret gunner Paige Tico, and many others. Eventually, Dameron's reckless actions landed him in trouble with his allies, and he was demoted from Wing Commander to the rank of Captain by General Organa following the evacuation of D'Qar, as well as a slap to the face from her. However, Organa was heavily injured during the subsequent attack on the Resistance fleet in which many veteran Rebels like Ackbar were killed, allowing Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo to take Organa's role as leader. To his shock, Holdo's plans involved the loss of gas for the Raddus, which would have allowed the First Order to eventually blow up the flagship and kill the remaining Rebels.
<p>Sure that Leia wouldn't have approved Holdo's direction, Poe teamed up with Lieutenant Kaydel Ko Connix, maintenance worker Rose Tico, BB-8, and Finn to organize a plan to save the Rebels. While Finn, Tico and BB-8 went to Canto Bight's casino in a mission to find a codebreaker, Poe and Connix remained aboard the Raddus. After Finn, Rose and BB-8 returned with DJ, the codebreaker they hired to infiltrate aboard the Supremacy, Poe and his allies started the mutiny against Holdo and her allies, with Poe trying to convince C-3PO to join his cause, although 3PO refused to be part of the mutiny for being unethical. However, Organa recovered by the time of the mutiny and after Holdo managed to escape from Poe's mutineers, the princess arrived on the bridge and fired a stun blast, knocking him out.
<p>Eventually, Organa decided to follow Holdo's plans to abandon ship. Said and done, every member of the Resistance evacuated, leaving Holdo aboard the Raddus to be blown up due to her decision to sacrifice herself in order to give time for the others to escape. However, aboard the Supremacy, Finn and Rose were subdued by the First Order stormtroopers, with Bee-Bee slipping out from captivity after being sold out by DJ for a large sum of money and his freedom, allowing Hux to order the destruction of the Resistance fleet. However, Holdo entered hyperspace on the Raddus, crashing it against the Supremacy, sacrificing herself in the process and causing the deaths of multiple First Order stormtroopers and officers. This action allowed Poe and the other Rebels escape to the mineral planet of Crait
<p>Once at Crait, the Rebels entered in the planet's outpost. During the ensuing battle, Poe commanded the Rebels and ultimately managed to weaken the First Order's army. However, they concluded that they would not be able to escape, but when Poe saw a vulptex running away through an unknown passageway, the Rebels followed him under Leia's orders to escape. However, the passageway ended in a hole too small for the Rebels to pass. Fortunately, while Luke Skywalker was fighting against Kylo Ren, Rey appeared and moved the rocks with the Force, allowing the Rebels to escape to fight another day. Once safe, Poe met Rey, and took the opportunity to introduce himself to the last Jedi.
<p>Now safe from the First Order, drinking accompanied by Rey, Finn and BB-8, Poe commented about their past experiences, leading Rey to tell him that she had learned they can't dwell on changing the past, rather concentrate in the present. Poe responded, however, that he just avoided a lot of heartache and that considering all they went through, it was hard to not think about different paths, prompting Finn to comment that had they would have met the scavenger together, perhaps he wouldn't have been knocked to the ground by her.
<p>As the former stormtrooper said that he believed Poe to have died in the TIE crash, Poe proceeded to state that he walked away from tons of crashes, telling Rey that there were extenuating circumstances to crash as she asked him why he crashed constantly if he was the "best" pilot of the galaxy. After Finn commented that perhaps Rey was the best pilot than him and Poe responded that at least they got away alive, Finn asked him how he survived, as he never explained him in detail how he got off-world from Jakku, leading Poe to recall and tell the story of his miracle survival.
<p>Poe continued to tell his adventures, even telling his friends how he felt over Takodana, leading Rey to comment that it sounded like he had the Force, but Poe refused and confirmed he was not Force-sensitive. Leia entered into the room and told him that the Force was with him, as it was with all of them. She then departed from the room to rest and asked Dameron to meet her afterwards to talk with him. Finn then left too to see if Rose was better, leaving Poe and Rey alone, both agreeing that Finn was a good person, as he saved their lives. Poe took the opportunity to ask her about her adventure with Luke Skywalker, but one of the porgs that Chewbacca adopted interrupted them, causing Rey to tell him about the small avian creatures.
<p>After commenting his wish of getting another X-Wing following the destruction of the Black One, Poe told Rey that he regretted the Resistance having deployed too soon from Takodana because they could have saved Kanata's castle from getting destroyed, causing her ask him about Kanata's status, to which Poe informed her that Kanata was alright. Rey then commented him about being tortured by Kylo Ren on his ship, to which Poe told her that Kylo did the same on him, calling themselves "torture buddies". He then proceed to tell her about his initial thoughts about Starkiller Base and his mission to drop Wexley inside a recon pod in order to let him scan the base, setting stage for the destruction of the base.

<center><h3>the final order</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>After Palpatine's broadcast of revenge announcing the Final Order, General Organa sent out agents to uncover information. Dameron, Chewbacca, Finn, Klaud, and R2-D2 took the Millennium Falcon to Sinta Glacier Colony. Dameron had to lightspeed-skip the Falcon to return to the base on Ajan Kloss, where he chastised Rey for remaining behind.
<p>Rey then decided to journey off and find a Sith wayfinder, in order to locate Palpatine. Rey and her friends then went to Pasaana, where they found Ochi of Bestoon's dagger. Chewbacca and the blade was presumed lost during the mission when a First Order transport he was believed to be on was destroyed by Rey's Force powers during a confrontation with Kylo Ren.
<p>With the inscription on the blade existing only in C-3PO's memory banks, but written in a forbidden language, Dameron suggested they find a black market droid smith he knew to force a translation. They then went to Kijimi, where they ran into his old spice smuggling partner, Zorii Bliss.
<p>Rey overpowered the gang, convincing Bliss to help them. Babu Frik was able to hack 3PO's memory, forcing a translation but wiping the droid. The Steadfast then arrived in orbit, with Chewbacca on board. They agreed to go rescue him, and Bliss passed on a First Order Captain's Medallion to get on board. They rescued Chewbacca, but were captured and due to be executed when General Hux revealed himself as a mole and freed them.
<p>The team boarded the Falcon and picked up Rey from another confrontation with Kylo Ren. They continued their journey to the moon of Endor, Kef Bir, where the wreckage from the DS-2 Death Star rested. After Rey dueled Kylo Ren and departed from them, Dameron's team returned to the Resistance base, where they were greeted with news of General Leia's passing, as she used the Force to reach out to Kylo Ren. Dameron was then promoted to acting general.
<p>After pooling their resources, they came up with a plan to reach Exegol and stop the Sith Eternal fleet. Dameron also promoted Finn to general. The Resistance fighters followed the trail to Exegol and engaged the fleet.
<p>However, their numbers were too few, and took heavy losses. Dameron was despairing, when the rallied Free Worlds sent hundreds of ships, allowing them to win the day. They then returned home, and during the celebrations, Dameron embraced his friends.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>personality &amp; traits</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>The son of a Rebel pilot and a Rebel commando, Dameron grew up on stories of Alliance campaigns, and while his mother taught him to fly and to love it, his father had taught him that when he committed to doing something, one committed to going all the way or not do it at all. Thanks to them, Dameron developed a strong sense of commitment and duty, but had trouble with the line between his commitment to the Resistance and the commitment to his comrades, willing to disobey a direct order from his superior, General Organa, to make sure that the Millennium Falcon safely left Starkiller Base before its imminent destruction. Dameron also wore his late mother's wedding ring on a necklace, wanting to eventually share it with the right person.
<p>Noted to be a "bad liar" by fellow comrades much to his indignation, Dameron had a headstrong nature which often led him into trouble, and a proud countenance that, those who did not know him, could mistake for arrogance. Confident in his skills and in his mission, he sometimes displayed an impatience that arose only from a desire to fulfill the task at hand. While daring with an appetite for risk as well as somewhat foolish, Leia Organa once noted that his need to do what was right and "maybe find a little adventure along the way", coupled with his outstanding piloting skills, reminded her of her brother, Luke Skywalker.
<p>Dameron regarded his fellow pilots Karé Kun, Jess Pava, L'ulo L'ampar, and Temmin Wexley, and the technician Oddy Muva as close friends that he could trust. Poe was also adventurous and willing to risk danger such as when he entered the Cave of the Crèche. Dameron treated his hosts with respect. Dameron's selfless and concern for the well-being of others led him to surrender himself to the First Order Agent Terex in an attempt to save the Crèche egg. As a commander, Dameron was a fair-minded and just leader who gave his Black Squadron mates ample room to improvise. Poe regarded his astromech droid BB-8 as a close friend who would aid him in combat and someone he could confide with. Poe was also magnanimous in victory and allowed Terex and his men to leave following the mission to Ovanis. This was also tempered by Dameron's unwillingness to provoke war between the First Order and the Resistance.
<p>Dameron and his Black Squadron mates' devotion to the Resistance cause led them to risk life and limb on several occasions including the Mission to Megalox Beta. Poe and his comrades managed to fight their way to Grakkus' fortress despite being double-crossed by the prison guards. When faced with competition from Terex, Poe showed resilience and ingenuity as a commander. He got BB-8 and the other astromech droids to lower Megalox prison's gravity shield; eliminating opposition from Terex and convincing Grakkus to accept their rescue offer.
<p>After learning there was a spy within the Resistance ranks, Dameron found himself unable to trust his Black Squadron mates despite regarding them as friends. Poe was also willing to walk into danger in an effort to recover information for the Resistance. During a Mission to Kaddak, Poe was only saved from capture by the efforts of C-3PO. While Poe was able to work well with droids like BB-8 and C-3PO, he found the commando droid "Nunzix" self-serving and irritating due to the droid's strong self-preservation mechanism. Poe was annoyed that the droid refused to disclose the information in his memory banks. Poe had little patience with Nunzix and expressed annoyance at the droid commando's unwillingness to fight; overlooking the fact that the droid had lost one of his arms. Poe's irritation with Nunzix was reinforced by his suspicion that the information Nunzix was carrying was a trap set by Terex.
<p>Due to their repeated encounters on several missions, Dameron came to regard Terex as a nemesis and blamed him for sowing distrust among his Black Squadron pilots. Poe was determined to root out the spy and eventually realized that the spy was Oddy Muva; who had been blackmailed by Terex into spying on the Resistance. Despite his hatred for Terex, Dameron did not seek to destroy the First Order agent and instead handed him back to his First Order superiors. While Dameron grieved the loss of one of his pilots L'ampar, he took comfort in the fact that Terex's Ranc gang fleet had been destroyed.
<p>By the end of the cold war, Dameron was a courageous hero of the Resistance dedicated to defeating the First Order. Though brash, Dameron had great charisma and limitless respect for the founders of the Resistance, particularly Leia Organa, a reason for which Organa tried to teach him that being a hero and being a leader wasn't the same thing. Organa was sure that Poe would be a great leader one day, but he still had a lot to learn, even though Dameron didn't agree. Dameron's fellow pilots joked that if the Resistance had recruitment posters, Dameron would triple their numbers with his dashing bravado alone. Unlike many starfighter pilots, Dameron delighted in atmospheric missions, soaring through skies and skimming the surfaces of planets.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>skills &amp; abilities</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Confident in his piloting skills, Dameron flew starships since he was six years old, and by the age of 32, he had became the most daring and skilled of the Resistance pilots. He was a decorated X-wing pilot who could fly anything, managing to familiarize himself with a TIE/sf fighter's controls in a matter of minutes and under pressure, as well as with a Pinnacle-class luxury ship. During the Battle on Takodana, he showed to be skilled enough to fire repeatedly without wasting a single energy burst and destroy multiple First Order assets. In addition to his piloting skills, Dameron was a capable infantryman, as he able to kill multiple stormtroopers on Jakku using his blaster rifile and kill many more using his pistol on the Steadfast when rescuing Chewbacca.
<p>L'ampar once observed that Dameron trusted his subordinates to figure things out on their own rather than give them bad orders, and saw it as the mark of a good commander. Dameron was also skilled in hand to hand combat which he used against the First Order and criminal proxies on several occasions. On a few occasions, Dameron was saved from the jaws of death by his indefatigable and loyal droid companion BB-8. Dameron was also known to practise with unarmed combat during his free time. Poe could also fly a rundown freighter, which he once used on an undercover mission.
<p>A speaker of Galactic Basic, Dameron also understood Binary, and thus had no need for reading BB-8's translated speech in a console to understand what the astromech said while plugged into his starfighter.
</div>
<br />

<center><h3>equipment</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Dameron generally used a customized T-70 X-wing called Black One. When on the ground, he fought with blasters including the Glie-44 blaster pistol and the EL-16HFE blaster rifle.

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>the file</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Julia Pennyworth is a disavowed spy of the Special Reconnaissance Regiment, known under the code-name Tuxedo One. She is the daughter of Alfred Pennyworth, the goddaughter of the late Lucius Fox, a longtime friend of Bruce Wayne and Luke Fox, and the ex-girlfriend/close friend of Kate Kane and Sophie Moore.
<p>Julia briefly posed as Batwoman to fool the agents of Crows Security and divert their attention away from Kate. Later after helping them uncover the corruption among their ranks, she joined the Crows and was charged to lead their new strike team together with Sophie, with whom she began a relationship.
<p>However, after Kate's disappearance, Julia's relationship with Sophie began to fall apart due to being secretive with the latter on knowing Kate's identity as Batwoman.
<p>Julia traveled to various places to investigate Kate's disappearance, which caught Enigma's attention, which made Julia forget her last memories and stop investigating. Julia then "found" pieces of bone that matched Kate's DNA in Blüdhaven, which made her think Kate was dead.
<p>Eventually, Julia discovered that she had memories missing; Alice then called her to help find Enigma, the hypnotist who Julia found out was Dr Evelyn Rhyme. When Julia confronts Evelyn at the base of the Crows, she is sedated and had her memories erased again, and this time Enigma made her ask for a transfer to Berlin.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>personality</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Julia appears as a charming and confident woman. She is proven to be a loyal friend to Kate Kane, whom she affectionately calls "luv" - something later she started to do with Sophie Moore as well. Julia helped Kate protect her secret identity, even risking her life in the process. When she learned that Sophie was in danger, Julia immediately took the bullet while tackling her out of the line of fire, despite not knowing Sophie. She also has a good sense of humor and is extremely sarcastic, loving to tease Kate and often engages in friendly bickering with her. Although she has a tendency to keep vital information to herself in order to protect her loved ones, often seeming to act shady, Julia always has the best of intentions and carries no qualms in being truthful and completely open when really needed.
<p>Julia is quite friendly and easygoing, having no problem discussing her intimate relationships with others and harbors no hard feelings towards her exes. However, she was visibly offended when Kate questioned her loyalty and stated that she didn't trust her.
<p>Julia has a treacherous side to her if she believes necessary, as she deceived Kate during their first meeting, hiding that Bruce Wayne had sent her to keep an eye on his cousin. Julia also seems keen to hide more darker secrets about herself, such as that she was no longer working for the SRR since operating for Safiyah Sohail. When Johnny Sabatino's men discovered this after kidnapping her, Julia ruthlessly killed both her captors to keep it hidden. Julia only revealed that she agreed to work with Safiyah to protect Kate from the Rifle when having no choice.

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>the file</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>When Walker was a teenager, he attended Custer's Grove High School, where he also met Lemar Hoskins and a woman named Olivia. Walker was the captain of the football team, although he would fail drama class. Eventually, he would marry Olivia and joined the United States Army with Hoskins.
<p>Having graduated from the United States Military Academy in 2010, Walker went on to have a successful career in the United States Army, performing numerous acts of valor. He became the first person in American history to receive three Medals of Honor and led RS One missions in counter-terrorism and hostage rescue. During one of his tours, he fought alongside Christina Raynor. Despite these honors, Walker had considered these days in Afghanistan to be the worst of his and Lemar Hoskins' lives.
<p>In the months following the retirement of Steve Rogers, the American government became aware of its need for a new symbolic hero to take his place. Sam Wilson, who had been trusted to become the next Captain America by Rogers himself, had donated the symbolic Captain America's shield to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.; feeling that he could not fulfill Rogers' legacy.
<p>The shield was quickly taken by the United States Department of Defense and given to Walker, who was nominated for his extensive military career. Shortly after receiving approval from the President, Walker was unveiled to the world and announced as "The New Captain America" by a Government Official, on the behalf of the Global Repatriation Council and the United States Department of Defense.
<p>Following his appointment, Walker began attending various meetings with government officials and made speeches as Captain America, duties that he did not express any genuine interest in. Fanfare about Captain America's return to the modern-day world was established soon after Walker was chosen to take on the mantle, making him a superhero celebrity in the process.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>personality</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Having been a career soldier all his life, John Walker modeled his work after Captain America, and prior to taking the Super Soldier Serum, only wanted to do what was good for his country. On Lemar Hoskins's admission, Walker maintained a sound acumen during his military career, making the most optimal decisions during the heat of battle. John Walker acknowledges to being uncertain on fulfilling the role as the new Captain America, admitting to be only trying his best to meet expectations. Walker also cares about his friends, choosing to save his friend Lemar Hoskins before confronting his enemies. When Walker attracted resentment from Steve Rogers' comrades Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes, he attempted to make amends with them by assisting them help them on several occasions, Walker felt scorned and embittered when Wilson and Barnes turned down his attempts of reconciliation. However, he retained some arrogance, looking down upon Wilson and Barnes as Rogers' "wingmen", rather than people he could learn from. Walker is also very prideful in his abilities and decorations, having attained three Medals of Honor during his military service.
<p>Due to the expectations and pressure mounting on him, John appears to be prone to outbursts, shoving a man for spitting in his face and refusing to answer his questions and ruining an attempt by Falcon to negotiate with Karli Morgenthau because he was impatient to arrest her. Walker has displayed condescending attitudes, as displayed when he attempted to deny the Dora Milaje custody of Baron Zemo on the claim of jurisdiction. He has a deep seated insecurity due to not being able to measure up to Captain America and the pressure put upon him to measure up to Steve Rogers. His ego is also shown to be extremely fragile, which in turn makes him prone to rash decisions. He was humiliated by his defeat to the Dora Milaje, shaming himself for not being able to take down a non-super soldier. After the ruined negotiations with Morgenthau, Bucky Barnes expressed concern about his mental stability, noting that Walker struck him as crazy, and Sam Wilson found Barnes' observations to be stating the obvious.
<p>Not long after, once Walker took the Super Soldier Serum himself, anything that may have been perceived as mental instability was exacerbated, and Walker became increasingly unstable. His outbursts came to a head after Hoskins was accidentally killed by Morgenthau, at which point he descended into a bitter and vengeful blind rage and chased down and brutally murdered Nico with his shield. He rationalized his horrific actions by convincing himself Nico, not Morgenthau, had killed Hoskins even going to the point of outright lying to Hoskins' family about who had killed him, in order to give them a sense of closure. This self-delusion continued after he was stripped of the Captain America mantle by the U.S. Government; as Walker convinced himself he was still Captain America, he later forged another shield directly patterned off of the vibranium original from his military decorations.
<p>However for all his flaws Walker is, deep down, still a morally decent man that cares about the protection of innocent lives. He was willing to abandon his revenge on Morgenthau, refusing to kill her when he had a chance, choosing to save the lives of the members of the Global Repatriation Council who were in imminent danger. He then reconciles with Wilson and Barnes, aiding them in their efforts to arrest the remaining Flag Smashers, later giving Wilson a nod of approval, finally accepting Wilson's role as the new Captain America. Due to his heroic efforts, Walker is later pardoned and reinstated by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, finally being ready to embrace his new role as the U.S. Agent.

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>the file</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Kanan Jarrus, born Caleb Dume, was a Force-sensitive human male Jedi Knight who survived Order 66 during the Clone Wars. Living on thanks to the sacrifice of his Master, Depa Billaba, on Kaller, he met the smuggler Janus Kasmir, who taught him how to survive as a fugitive. Going into hiding, he forsook the Jedi ways for some time, swapping his blue-bladed lightsaber for a blaster. After working with the Twi'lek rebel operative Hera Syndulla during the Gorse conflict, Jarrus decided to join her nascent rebel cell.
<p>As Syndulla's second-in-command, the two came to develop a romantic relationship. After the Force-sensitive teenager Ezra Bridger joined the Spectres, Jarrus became his Jedi mentor despite still being a Padawan. After defeating the Grand Inquisitor in combat, Jarrus and his fellow rebels learned they were part of a larger rebellion and joined Phoenix Cell. During a mission to Malachor, Jarrus was blinded by the former Sith Lord Maul. After months of retreat, Jarrus restored his connection to the Force and repaired his frayed relationship with Bridger with the help of a mysterious being called Bendu, who taught him to see things through the Force.
<p>The reinvigorated Jarrus and his fellow rebels continued to fight various adversaries including Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn and Maul, who sought to corrupt Bridger and destroy Obi-Wan Kenobi, the key to destroying the Sith. Regaining his confidence, Jarrus also taught the Mandalorian rebel Sabine Wren how to wield the Darksaber and helped her to rally the Mandalorians over to the rebel cause. As the Rebel Alliance escalated its struggle with the Empire, Kanan and his fellow rebels returned to free Lothal, a world which they had a special connection with.
<p>Jarrus eventually met his death on Lothal around the year of the Battle of Yavin, during the rescue of Hera Syndulla after Governor Arihnda Pryce ordered her walker to fire on the fuel pod they were on, sacrificing himself to allow his fellow rebels to escape. Following Jarrus' death, he became a part of the Cosmic Force, manifesting as a huge loth-wolf named Dume, which appeared to Ezra several times. Later, Hera gave birth to their son, whom she named Jacen.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>personality &amp; traits</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>During his youth, Kanan Jarrus (or rather, Caleb Dume) had a tendency to ask many questions, hoping to better understand things, which earned him somewhat of a bad reputation among his peers, but it was that inquisitive nature that motivated Billaba to choose him as her apprentice. She would, however, tease him about it, such as when she said questions seemed to be the "natural state" of his mind. Young as he was, he was also reckless, rushing headlong into danger. Any disrespect against his master would anger him, as did being called "kid." Another peculiarity was that every time he got nervous, he would run his hand through his hair.
<p>A secretive man, Jarrus would rarely talk about his past, as he disliked talking about it, particularly before meeting Hera Syndulla on Gorse. Before her, Jarrus was reckless, impatient and belligerent, as demonstrated by the little care he put in carrying explosives just to meet his schedule, or his tendency to start fights. Seemingly prickly and detached, Jarrus showed his kindness and commitment to justice only when he thought no one was looking, and his only aim in life was survival, until he met Syndulla. She persuaded him to join her to fight for a lost way of life—to work as a rebel leader, for which he resumed his lost qualities of bravery, honor, and perseverance. The two later developed a romantic relationship.
<p>Having felt adrift since the destruction of the Jedi way of life, he had developed a cynical and cocky personality, and couldn't stand "protocol nonsense." He was also known for humorous banter and for having "a thousand one-liners ready to go."
<p>Never having made it past the rank of Padawan until years into Ezra's training, Jarrus had little confidence in his skills as a Jedi and teacher. He was self-conscious about his incomplete Jedi training, and thus hesitated to train Ezra Bridger. Furthermore, Depa Billaba's last words haunted him and, as the Inquisitor once commented, the former Jedi was afraid of his own power, afraid to wear his lightsaber out in the open. However, during a lightsaber duel with the Sentinel, a manifestation of the Grand Inquisitor as a Jedi Temple Guard, Jarrus realized he should feel content with teaching Ezra all he could, and to his surprise, he was Knighted by the Sentinel. Jarrus's experiences during the Clone Wars left him wary of being involved with military affairs. When the Ghost crew was faced with the opportunity to join Phoenix Squadron and become full-fledged members of the Rebel fleet, Jarrus was reluctant to go along, citing his distaste for military protocol and the broader consequences of fighting a war, and became apprehensive and disdainful.
<p>Jarrus also harbored substantial animosity towards clone troopers for the role they had played in killing Billaba and hunting him down. As a result, Jarrus found it difficult to trust the retired clones Rex, Gregor and Wolffe, and yet, despite his hard feelings towards them, Kanan decided to rescue them during an Imperial assault on Seelos. After Rex joined the Rebellion and befriended his apprentice Ezra, Jarrus argued with the clone on a few occasions about how to train the young Jedi. Despite his issues with clones, Jarrus was able to work with Rex to rescue Ezra and several other Phoenix rebels during a rescue mission aboard the Imperial Interdictor.
<p>As a result of attaining Jedi Knighthood during his Jedi Trials at the Lothal Jedi Temple, Kanan resolved to keep his apprentice Ezra from falling to the dark side. Kanan was willing to die for this cause. Having grown up during the last years of the Jedi Order, Kanan distrusted the former Sith apprentice Maul and realized that he wanted to use Ezra for his powers. Kanan's distrust of Maul was confirmed when the darksider blinded him on Malachor.
<p>Kanan's blinding had a great impact on the Jedi Knight's life and worldview. Kanan withdrew from his responsibilities in Hera's rebel cell and the Phoenix Squadron to meditate in the Force. Due to his upbringing, Kanan distrusted anything associated with the Sith and dark side and chastised Ezra for toying with a Sith holocron he had found on Malachor. Under the tutelage of the Bendu, Kanan learned to see through the Force, overcome his fears of the spider-like krykna, and repair his strained relationship with Ezra. By repairing his relationship with his rebel friends, Kanan was able to regain his connection to the Force.
<p>Kanan was a strict and methodical teacher. Due to Sabine's initial lack of enthusiasm for the Darksaber, Kanan believed that it would be safer for her to begin her training by sparring with melee sticks and learning the basic lightsaber strokes. As a seasoned Jedi, Kanan was knowledgeable of history and familiar with Mandalorian vambraces. His emphasis on skills and discipline clashed with Sabine's free-spirited and improvised style of combat. The two were able to resolve their differences after Sabine overcame her strained memories of her family and Kanan decided to trust Sabine's ability to bond with the Darksaber herself.
<p>While Kanan expressed doubts that he was a good teacher for his apprentice Ezra since he had not completed his own training, Ezra reassured his master that he had taught him about life and how to be a better person. Kanan tried to reason with Bendu to aid the rebellion against Thrawn's Imperial forces but underestimated the creature's stubborn devotion to neutrality and volatile temperament. Kanan later complimented his former adversary Agent Kallus for risking his life to aid the rebellion. Due to his past experiences, Kanan was also able to look past the rebels' crushing defeat at Atollon. He reassured his apprentice that they were fortunate to survive and that this meant they could continue fighting for a free galaxy.
<p>He and Hera came to believe that the Spectres had a special connection to Lothal and that they were predestined to cross paths with Ezra. While Kanan loved Hera and was reluctant to abandon her, he heeded the wolf's warning not to go into Capital City and instead evacuated the rebels Chopper and Mart Mattin.

<center><h3>trivia</h3></center>
<p>&#9642; When Maul blinds Kanan , it appears that his saber slashes his eyes out completely, as his empty eye sockets can be seen for a split second. However, this was changed so that Kanan's eyes turned pure white rather than getting torn out completely.
<p>&#9642; Because Darth Vader sliced Kanan's right arm armor, Kanan now has a burn mark on his rebellion symbol.
<p>&#9642; Prior to Kanan joining the Rebellion, he was a freighter pilot/smuggler.

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>the file</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Leto was the only child of Duke Mintor Atreides out of the concubine Bekah, who died in delivery.
<p>He was trained as a matador and received combat training in operations on Wallor Tertius. He served on the Atreides flagship Van Atreides as a subaltern.
<p>He was granted authority at 16, when Duke Mintor sent him as the Designated Observer for House Atreides to the revolt at Mask Prime. During a planetary assault, Leto felt the strategy was weak, and unilaterally withheld the Atreides contingent. Indeed 3 brigades and at least 2 cruisers of Houses Harkonnen and Kaastaar were destroyed.
<p>His patient and lifesaving tactics of siege, psywar and sabotage had worked brilliantly; the na-Duke was in the Palace of Mask, in complete control of the rebellious planet, when a new contingent of Imperial levies was sent to their aid. A subsequent Imperial Inquest concurred that the original attack plan was badly flawed. Thanks to Leto's judgment, the Atreides forces were among the only survivors of the carnage.
<p>This first sign of his legendary judgment and strong leadership won him the immediate loyalty of the Atreides forces from then on.
<p>Leto was only partway through his military training, under the general tutelage of the famed household mentat Thufir Hawat, when Duke Mintor was killed in the Corrida in 10163 AG.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>dukedom</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>The new Duke demanded the right to avenge his father's death on the horns of El Muerte, a symbolic and politically astute act to prove his bravery and win the support and trust of the Caladan people. Leto entered the corrida for a last time, only to kill El Muerte with his father's estoque.
<p>Soon after ascending the Ducal throne, Leto had to encounter a mutiny within his own troops on the planet Pinskau, who held prisoners their own officers. Leto took the time and care to uncover the true reason for his and to ensure that their totally justifiable grievances were dealt with. This was a chance to cement the loyalty of his troops forever, by sheer force of personality and evidence of his unbreakable integrity.
<p>Shaddam IV, a devotee of the Corrida, had taken a mild interest in Leto ever since his ascension to the Ducal throne. After the mutiny, Leto was summoned to a private audience with the emperor. It is reported that the emperor wished to discuss nothing but the battle with El Muerte, but they held the meeting so long that his schedules were being thrown off and upon the repeated urgings of his social secretary the audience had to end.
<p>From 10158 AG until 10174 AG, Duke Leto continued to make a name for himself as one of the most honorable of the nobility. When House Harkonnen managed a raid on House Tipnear, a close ally of House Atreides, Leto summoned household troops of House Chusak (another victim of Harkonnen raids) and Tipnear and proceeded in retaliation with a "black" raid on Giedi Prime in 10165 AG. A combined force of Atreides Guards and allies landed on Giedi Prime and took over the slave-market city of Baathaas: approximately 20000 slaves were freed, and immense damage was done to the Harkonnen slaving fleet based there. The slaves were taken to Caladan where they were given their freedom and were offered passage to any of the systems that had taken part in the raid. This was the action that brought Gurney Halleck, into the service of House Atreides.
<p>The retaliation was "black" since it was without flags or insignia, no declaration of war, no admission of participation afterwards, and it was a typical example of the adventures he embarked upon during that period.
<p>The Duke managed another victory in the Battle of Thar system (10167 AG), for which he was granted the title Chevalier of the Imperium by Emperor Shaddam IV Corrino, not only a symbol of his undeniable bravery, but also of Shaddam's growing respect for him.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>marriage &amp; family</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>The Duke refused to marry for political reasons. While he had no concubine in the Castle, he had the habit of selling his concubines their own contracts after a short time, usually for a penny. When his buyers brought him a lady who eventually bored him, he dismissed his buyers with distressing regularity.
<p>In 10175 AG, one of the Duke's buyers, with some trepidation, and after careful investigation by the mentat Thufir Hawat, brought the Duke Jessica Atreides/DE as a Bound Concubine for his household, a present from the headmistress of the [[Bene Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]] school on Caladan.
<p>After a few hours the Duke arrived for his meal with the new concubine on his arm (a privilege never granted any other concubine) and during the dinner, he included Jessica in the table conversation.
<p>The next day, Leto summoned the buyer to him and announced that he was dismissed. The buyer was stunned, and began stammering apologies to the Duke, but the Duke explained to him that he no longer required his services, and offered him the position of a quartermaster-general and take charge of all trade to and from Caladan.
<p>It was announced five months later that the Lady Jessica was to bear the Duke's first child. A boy was born four months later, and was named Paul. This new family led the Duke to adopt a more domestic lifestyle. He no longer paced the castle like a caged animal when there was peace (though he still went on campaign with his troops whenever the Levy was summoned, and fought bravely in their front). He threw himself fully into the education of his son, so that he would grow up worthy of the Atreides crest.
<p>With the able assistance of Warmaster Halleck and Swordmaster (later Warmaster) Duncan Idaho, Leto began training Paul in command as soon as Paul could speak.
<p>The emperor's affection resulted to jealous nobles attempting to undermine Leto's position at the court. In the Battle of Grumman (10176 AG), Atreides forces again saved the day, making Shaddam IV (always suspicious, like all emperors) and his counselors realize that too much success on the battlefield is much worse than too little: Leto with his incredibly loyal troops, would become too powerful, too popular, and (in spite of his obvious loyalty) a threat to the throne.
<p>Thus it was that by the enemies of the Atreides hatched a plan, which require the transplantation of House Atreides from Caladan to Arrakis, in the guise of a reward.
<p>Despite falling in love with Jessica himself, Leto never married Jessica. His refusal to marry Jessica was driven by his astute political insticts; he had developed a reputation among the other Great Houses and had become very popular in the Landsraad. While he remained single he ensured that House Atreides was open to political alliance with those other Houses.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>migration to arrakis</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>After almost two decades of rule on Caladan with the Lady Jessica, Leto was ordered by the Emperor to take over the planetary fief of Arrakis from House Harkonnen, and thus was required to move his House from Caladan to 'Dune'. Arrakis was a notoriously difficult planet to manage, but as the only source of the spice melange, it was also unimaginably important. Thus the role brought both jeopardy and the jealousy of Leto's fellow noblemen among the Great Houses. Thus, Leto leapt at the chance to increase his standing in the Landsraad, even though he knew it would also put his House in great peril. Leto committed all his resources to the venture, and it was said that to illustrate this point to his people and the people of Arrakis, that upon his arrival he planted a flag upon the battlements at Arrakeen and proclaimed: "Here I am, here I remain!"
<p>Leto's resolve was strengthened by a letter the Emperor had sent him upon his Arrival on Arrakis. Addressed to his "Noble Duke", the letter outlined that Leto was given House Corrino's full support to introduce and uphold the rule of the Faufreluches. This letter served to illustrate Corrino duplicity, for at the same time, Shaddam IV was plotting Leto's demise.
<p>During consolidation of his rule over Arrakis, Leto made a quick and positive impact on the people of Dune. His fairhandedness, political savvy, and personal charisma saw many in Arrakeen society, from the Fremen to the aristocratic Houses Minor, become supporters. However, only a short while into Leto's rule on Dune, the Emperor gave Baron Vladimir Harkonnen approval to invade and destroy House Atreides, even going so far as to provide some of his own Sardaukar in support. The Emperor's urgency in disposing of House Atreides was amplified by the fact that he had come to know that the Duke Leto had managed to develop a small force of soldiers capable of rivalling the Emperor's Sardaukar. This had been accomplished through Leto's principal advisors and generals, namely Thufir Hawat, Duncan Idaho, and Gurney Halleck.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>death</h3></center>
<p>During the invasion Leto was betrayed by his private Suk Doctor, Wellington Yueh, and turned over to the Harkonnens. Though Yueh had given Leto the chance to kill the Baron Harkonnen using a poisoned tooth embedded in the Duke's mouth, the scheme failed. Consequently Leto died during the assassination attempt, but the Baron Harkonnen survived - although his twisted mentat Piter de Vries was killed by the poison.
<p>Some years later, Leto's remains were recovered by his son Paul in Arrakeen. Paul laid his father's remains to rest in the Skull Tomb in the desert of Arrakis. The late Duke's legacy was felt in Paul's reign as Emperor, and also in the conception of a daughter Alia, carried by Jessica but only discovered after Leto's death.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>legacy</h3></center>
<p>In some ways, Leto lived on in his son Paul and grandson Leto II, through their possession of Other Memory. It was also partially Leto's love for Duncan Idaho that saw Leto II maintain a series of Idaho gholas throughout his reign. During both Paul's and Leto II's reign, millions flocked to visit Leto I's shrine, since Atreides ancestry had taken on a religious mystique. More than this however, Leto came to symbolise all that was good about the Atreides bloodline, namely courage, integrity, loyalty, justice, and honour. Because of this some have postulated that had Leto survived his rule of Arrakis, he would have eventually commanded the same fanaticism of the Fremen with which they came to follow his son Paul. Indeed, some have taken this argument further and postulated that his popularity with those he ruled, combined with his popularity in the Landsraad, may have seen him eventually ascend to the Golden Lion Throne. Thus, the positive strength of character and many talents Leto was generally regarded to possess, and the possibilities of what might have been, illustrates the inherent tragedy of his story.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>chracter</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Throughout his lifetime, Leto showed faith in and care for his troops and commanders. His fairness and wisdom gained him a House force famous as the most loyal, trustworthy and honorable in the Imperium.
<p>Nevertheless, the Duke continued being Leto the Just, administering Caladan as best he knew. He had the habit of taking promising young orphans into the Household, where they were raised as members of his own family. At times, there were up to a dozen children in Castle Caladan, who would stay until they were apprenticed off to a good master. The Duke had the habit of selling his concubines their own contracts after a short time, usually for a penny and a habit of dismissing his buyers with distressing regularity when they brought him a lady who eventually bored him.
<p>His reputation made those less worthy continually sniped at Leto, thinking his example to be a subtle insult against themselves. Leto's refusal to marry for political reasons did not help against this attitude.
<p>The emperor's acknowledgement of Leto as an exemplar of correct Noble behavior very likely led, paradoxically, to his demise, death and the near-destruction of his house; the emperor's obvious affection for Leto caused intense jealousy among those not so favored. The Court was almost universally illdisposed toward this upstart Duke from some unknown backwater planet whose only export was the insignificant and distasteful "pundi rice".

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>the file</h3></center>
<p>Duncan came under the service of the Atreides after observing that they ruled in stark contrast to the Harkonnens. The Atreides appeared to garner fierce loyalty from those who served them, and Duncan was no different. However, as Atreides Swordmaster he maintained a hypervigilance against potential threats to the Atreides, even within their own ranks. As a result, he developed a distrust of the Lady Jessica, as he knew that her Bene Gesserit origins were likely to involve some secret scheme against the Atreides. However, Duncan underestimated Jessica's love for her Duke, which was so strong that she disobeyed her Sisterhood. Indeed, in matters regarding the Lady Jessica, Duncan's judgment was somewhat clouded, since he was secretly in love with her.
<p>A graduate of the Ginaz school, Duncan was charged by Duke Leto with training his son Paul in the art of war. This involved hand-to-hand combat and military strategy. These skills Duncan imparted on the young Paul in conjunction with Thufir Hawat and Gurney Halleck. When compared to Gurney, Duncan appeared to fight with more finesse but Gurney was regarded as more lethal, typically beating Duncan six times out of ten. This seemed to give Paul a well-rounded education.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>early years</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Idaho was born on Giedi Prime. His parents were minor government office workers but at an early age he and his family felt the wrath of the Harkonnens: his family, parents, uncle and two cousins were captured in an afternoon in Harko City. Idaho was Number 11368, and trained to be hunted for sport.
<p>One time, Idaho managed to escape his captors. He entered a sunspensor tube where the guards could not use lasguns. When he saw a bullet-train approaching, he managed to fall in a hatch. There he was trapped, however the guards who found him later, told him that he "made it".
<p>Duncan's family was visited by Glossu Rabban Harkonnen to be congratulated for his ingenuity and be taken for a second round with Rabban, who recently disappointed by a sandworm hunt on Arrakis. When he called the boy as "Number 11368", Duncan defiantly mentioned his true name; Rabban shot both his parents with a lasgun and his men forced Duncan outside.
<p>The next time he was left outside in the open, armed only with a handlight, a rope and a knife. Duncan decided to use the knife and remove the tracer implanted on his shoulder. Using it as a bait, it lured one of the hunters in a rock opening, and then Duncan crushed him by pushing a boulder above him. Then, after cutting his throat he took a medpak and his lasgun.
<p>With the medpak he managed to fix his shoulder wound, and then had some practice with the lasgun. He managed to drive away a gaze hound that attacked him. Using the handlight in the snow, he lured his trackers and shot some of them in a lasgun fray. With its charge running low, Duncan started to run towards a blinking light, which turned out to be a flitter. He entered it, only to be caught by Janess Milam, the woman who gave his family to the Harkonnens.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>In the Service of Duke Paulus</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Having to repent, she planned to send Duncan to the Atreides; she arranged with Renno the Second mate of a cargo craft that Idaho could board the ship and escape the planet. He found his way to Caladan and he was determined to find Duke Atreides.
<p>He started to work as a farm worker in the rice paddies and then as a net-rigger on a fishing boat from the Southern Continent. As they reached a port on the Western Continent. He began hitching rides on groundtrucks and cars, and sneaked aboard tube trains and cargo ornithopters until he drove close to Castle Caladan. In conversations with other travelers, he was shocked to realize that the people there loved and respected their ruler instead of fearing him, much unlike the situation on Giedi Prime.
<p>Eventually (after denied entrance and spending a night in the courtyard), he was allowed audition to the Duke. He narrated his full story and pledged his loyalty to the service of House Atreides.
<p>Initially he worked in the stables under Stablemaster Yresk. After exposing the successful assassination plot of Lady Helena Atreides against the beloved Duke Paulus Atreides, he rose up to eventually become the Atreides' swordmaster and trusted advisor.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>move to arrakis</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Later, when the Atreides gained the Arrakis fief, under the order of the Emperor, Idaho became Duke Leto's ambassador to the Fremen, the people native to Dune that Leto hoped would ally with him in the feud against House Harkonnen. Idaho was so impressed with the Fremen, that he took dual allegiances, one to the Atreides, one to the Fremen.
<p>When the Emperor launched an attack on Arrakeen in the guise of Harkonnen troops, Idaho was killed by the Emperor's Sardaukar by a blow to the head, but not before he dispatched no less than seventeen Sardaukar soldiers single-handedly. In so doing, he rescued the Duke's son Paul Atreides, who later became the first Emperor in the dynasty of House Atreides, and Duke Leto's concubine, the Lady Jessica.
<p>Due to his taking out an astondishing number of sardaukar forces, his body was frozen and sent to the Bene Tleilax axolotl tanks for regeneration. Amid the cosmic concerns and Machiavellian forces that swirled around him, Duncan contributed the glories of ancient times to a millennium that might otherwise have been sterile in its preoccupation with great issues. His devil-may-care humanity and frailty provided color and excitement.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>origin of the duncan idaho ghola</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Following the death of Duncan Idaho at the hands of the Sardaukar and the forces of House Harkonnen, the body of the trusted aide of House Atreides fell into the hands of the Tleilaxu.
<p>The original ghola, named Hayt before reclaiming his original name, was presented as a gift to Paul Atreides, with the intention of assassinating the Emperor after the death of his concubine Chani. However, after the cellular memories of the original Duncan Idaho arose and prevented the ghola from completing that task, he became a trusted servant of Paul, and later the lover of Paul's sister Alia.
<p>The reawakening of the memories of Duncan Idaho proved to be pivotal, not least for the Bene Tleilax, who had been attempting to accomplish such a feat for thousands of years without success. Subsequently they continued to create numerous more gholas over the following millennia.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>variances</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Each was unique, exhibiting differences in training, conditioning, and disposition. Such changes varied depending on the mood and ambition of the Tleilaxu at the time of their creation.
<p>The demand for Duncan Idaho gholas remained after the ascendancy of Leto Atreides II, the God-Emperor. Leto II relied heavily on a succession of Duncan Idaho gholas to fulfill his Golden Path, while the Bene Tleilax willingly supplied them in the hope of destroying the powerful God-Emperor through deception and subterfuge.
<p>Successive gholas were often based on the genetic material of a previous Idaho ghola, rather than the original Duncan Idaho. This led to a sporadic accumulation of memories and experiences, but also provided a genetic throwback through which new traits of the Atreides line could be plucked or refined.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>characteristics</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>A true swashbuckler, his black goatish hair over sharp, dark features, his chin marked by a small mole, his never- relinquished habit of the insignia-less, black uniform of the Atreides' House Guard, and his gently observant eyes melted women's hearts and often made him the designated Atreides' escort.
<p>Duncan was a man out of his time who carved magic in an age of rationality and contrivance. He recalled an age when noble action was always the most admirable choice, when virtue was self- evident and at the call of the bright and the good, and when loyalty was the greatest gift.
<p>The many gholas of Duncan Idaho created over the ensuing centuries retained the original Duncan's unique characteristics. The God Emperor recognized Duncan's charms, and used it to maintain the Fish Speakers' bond to the Duncans, and the gholas were the asexual Leto II's gift to his amazons. However, in his fear of the relationship between Duncan-the- Last and Hwi Noree, Leto II remarked in his diaries that Duncan could always see into the souls of women and get them to do whatever he wanted. While he was rarely simply a Lothario, Duncan was a romantic figure, often called "an aristocrat of the sword."
<p>Even as a ghola, he was a poet in actions and words, and "The Ghola's Hymn," Duncan-10208's eulogy for his young master," remains one of the tenderest expressions of the spirit of Duncan and the House Atreides. In her commentaries and before her abomination, St. Alia-of-the-Knife described Duncan as a vulnerable "child-man-adolescent" under seige. His whimsy and attractiveness were always constants in the eyes of the Atreides, much to their misfortune, but certainly to the betterment of later ages.

<h4>headcanons</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>trivia</h3></center>
<p>&#9642; gholas are not clones. a ghola was an artificially created human, who was replicated from a dead individual. Gholas were created in Axlotl tanks and could be reconstructed from as little as one cell from the original being.
<p>&#9642; To be considered a true ghola, the cells used to grow the ghola were collected after the original human had died, whereas a clone is grown from cells collected while the original human was still alive. Clones do not possess a "death memory" when the original memories are restored.
<p>&#9642; Gholas possessed most (if not all) of the memories of the source human, thanks to a combination of conditioning and a variant on genetic memory.
<p>&#9642; Gholas originally possessed artificial 'metallic' eyes, due to an initial problem with the method of ghola production. This was later resolved, resulting in them possessing natural eyes.

<h4>biography</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>the file</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>The Darkling was born many centuries ago to Baghra and an unknown Heartrender. He was raised by Baghra and never knew his father.
<p>Due to his and his mother's unique powers during a time of heavy persecution against Grisha, he had a nomadic childhood and lived in secrecy, rarely staying in one location under one identity for more than a month at a time for safety. His mother warned against showing off his powers or allowing anyone to touch him for fear they would discover he was an amplifier. He was a sweet but lonely boy, and despite his powers, he was afraid of the dark, loved sunlight, and initially struggled with mastering his powers.
<p>At 13, at the time under the name Eryk while stationed at a Grisha camp near the Fjerdan border, two other children at the camp attempted to drown him in a freezing lake after finding out he was an amplifier, one of whom he had befriended and trusted. He used the Cut for the first time and framed the nearby otkazat'sya village. His mother, at the time going by the name Lena, told him she didn't blame their kind for the desperation to protect themselves. It was at this moment that he swore to make a safe place for Grisha.
<p>The Darkling, under the name Leonid, was one of the first Grisha to offer his services to the King Yevgeni Lantsov, helping him to defeat Shu Han in a tough battle. For his reward, he rejected gold and instead requested a sanctuary for Grisha in exchange for a trained army. It was unpopular as Grisha were treated with suspicion, but he was able to establish the Little Palace and Second Army.
<p>Over time, he became more corrupt. The Darkling's experimentation with power and darkness resulted in the creation of the Shadow Fold, in the period when he was still known as the Black Heretic. The Darkling served many kings over the years and faked his death many times. He planned to expand the Fold and gain power over Ravka but needed a Sun Summoner to destroy the volcra and carry out his ambitions.
<p>Alina Starkov was brought before the Darkling after a failed attempt to cross the Shadow Fold resulted in a mysterious light saving her and her friend Malyen Oretsev. After witnesses shared what they saw on the skiff, the Darkling did not believe that Alina was a Sun Summoner and decided to conduct a test. After covering the room in darkness, he tried to call out to the magic inside her, but she actively resisted. Instead of falling for her trick, the Darkling decided to use physical force, cutting her arm with a knife, and the pain triggered a response in Alina: a blazing white light that shattered the darkness he conjured.
<p>Later it is revealed that the Darkling is also a living amplifier, a person who can increase a Grisha's powers. There are also inanimate objects that are used as amplifiers but only the Darkling's most favored Grisha are allowed to have them. The Darkling did not interact much with Alina again while at the palace, but he appeared one day at Baghra's hut and told Alina that he might be able to get her the most powerful amplifier ever.
<p>After Alina finally accepted her powers, the Darkling visited her again during a training session. He had still not found Morozova's Stag whose antlers he had promised her but he asked that she have faith in him, and then he kissed her to both of their surprise. After the King and Queen's winter fete, Alina learned that Baghra was the Darkling's mother, He was the Black Heretic who created the Shadow Fold, and that his plan was to use Alina to fend off the volcra that kept him from using the Fold.
<p>When he caught Alina and Mal after they ran away, he used the stag's antlers to bind her to him, and then he revealed that he planned on having Mal killed by the volcra. He used Alina's powers to show his own powers over the Fold and easily scared the ambassadors and envoys that came along for the demonstration into submission. When he ordered Mal to be thrown overboard, Alina broke free from his control and left the people on the boat to fend off the volcra themselves. The Darkling was one of the only people to have survived the volcra attack.
</div>
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>personality</h3></center>
<p>The Darkling is an extremely dark and manipulative person. He is power-hungry and had created the Fold with merzost, in order to use it against his enemies. In the process created the Volcra which prevented him from expanding it. He is also ambitious. He wants the Grisha to be free from slavery and oppression and planned to use the fold as leverage against those people who built the pyre (where they burn Grisha), and not only against his own enemies. He feels the loneliness of immortality, causing him to fixate on Alina because she had the capacity to be like him. However, he is also shown to truly care for and wants to be loved by his people (the Grisha) and his nation, claiming that all he ever wanted was to create a safe place for people like him. He willingly sacrifices himself to stop the blight and save Ravka, with his only condition being that he is recognized as a Saint.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>physical description</h3></center>
<p>The Darkling is described as a tall handsome young man, appearing not much older than Alina despite his ancient age. He has ink-black hair, gray eyes, and sharp, beautiful features.

<center><h3>trivia</h3></center>
<p>&#9642; <b>the creation of the shadow fold:</b> Many centuries ago, known then as the Black Heretic, the Darkling returned home to his partner Luda, who was also a Grisha Healer. Not long after his return, their home was surrounded by the King’s soldiers, demanding that the Darkling turn himself over. The Darkling did as instructed and gave himself up peacefully. However, the King's men had no intentions of bringing him in and shot the Darkling with arrows. Fortunately, Luda remained hidden inside, healing the Darkling as he was struck with each arrow. However, one of the soldiers managed to capture Luda and kill her. Enraged by her death, the Darkling used the Cut, killing nearly a dozen of the King’s men.
<p>The Darkling rode on horseback to the sanctuary with Luda’s body, hoping to heal her, but he was too late. The Darkling then informed his mother of the soldiers sweeping west. Baghra blamed the Darkling for making the King afraid, so now in turn he sought to make the Grisha fear him. The Darkling reminded Baghra that she taught him how to kill, meaning their blood is on her hands as much as his own. She urged him to flee west to Kerch and wait for the King to die. Then he could return under a new identity and make peace with the new King. However, the Darkling refused to run while Grisha were in trouble. He sought to train them how to fight, but with so few of them actually knowing for to fight, the Darkling decided he would make a new army as Morozova did by forging new life to amplify their power using merzost.
<p>Despite his mother’s warning, the Darkling sought out Morozova’s journals in the archives. Just outside the sanctuary stood more of the King’s men, armed with arrows. The King wanted the Darkling in custody. Surrounded by dozens of soldiers, the Darkling raised his hands. Using merzost, he turned the King’s men into his own army, unintentionally creating the Fold in the process.
