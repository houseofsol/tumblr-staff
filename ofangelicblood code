<p>hello lovies! most everyone calls me <b>kc</b>. 30+/f/pst
<p>while i don't have a full time job i make it a point not to spend every waking hour on tumblr. i'm here as much as i feel like i can. and when i'm not you can always find me lurking on discord.
<br /><br />

<p><center><h3>disclaimer&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>
<p>(1) this blog was created for roleplaying purposes. i am not jace herondale, dominic sherwood and i don’t own anything to do with freeform, shadowhunters or the books on which the show is based.
<p>(2) this is a <b>DRAMA FREE</b> zone. i’m not here to get pulled into the drama involving the tv show versus the books. i’m here to write. if you’re a book based muse great! i’m an adult and i can read if you point me in the right direction. tv based muse? that works too! if you try to drag me into your drama i will drop you in a heartbeat without a second thought.
<br /><br />

<p><center><h3>if nothing else read this&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>
<p>(1) jace's portrayal is one i've worked a long time on. i will NOT change my interpretation of my muse in ways that detract from his core foundations. my muse is my own entity. if i start noticing that you’re ignoring parts of my character because you don’t like it/don’t agree with it, i reserve the right to drop all threads without warning.
<p>(2) start drama with me about my friends? block me now - because we’re done.
<p>(3) i unfollow for the following:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9642; too much political content<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9642; posting of drama<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9642; too much negativity
<p>(4) this blog runs on a <b>queue</b>. all replies are scheduled so i'm not overwhelmed with drafts and i have a chance to breathe. if this is something you're uncomfortable with this may not be the blog for you.
<p>(5) interactions with muns 21+ is preferred. muns 18-21 will be considered & there will be no interactions with muns under 18. if you have no age listed on your blog i won’t interact nor follow.
<br /><br />

<p><center><h3>about&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>
<p>(1) this blog is based on the freeform show and is canon current. the mun has plans to read the books but as it will be slow going we will interact with book based muses with some guidance. the mun also has no problems reading the wikia for book based threads if necessary.
<p>(2) all series will be written on this blog but any threads that exist in series three will contain spoilers based on the weekly episode. all spoilers from the episode will be tagged appropriately for at least one week following the episode. after that spoiler tags can’t be guaranteed.
<p>(3) this blog is <b>queue</b> heavy. what that means is all of the replies will be put into a queue that will post four (4) replies every day. this is for my sanity and to keep the dash from being flooded with replies. don’t hesitate to send me an ask if you want to know when your reply will be posted.
<p>(4) this blog has a <b>weekend rule</b>. what that means is each saturday and sunday will be spent away from tumblr completely. no replies, no follow backs, no asks, no nothing on tumblr will be done until the following monday.
<p>(5) the queue is tagged for your blacklisting purposes.
<p>(6) this blog is <b>highly selective</b>. what that means is i will carefully look over a blog to see whether or not i can see myself writing with them. i also look to see if our writing could be compatible. this blog is also <b>mutuals</b> only. meaning if i follow you and you follow me. all starter calls are for <b>mutuals only</b>. please double check to see if we are following each other before or liking a starter call. <b>memes</b> are now open to <b>non-mutuals</b>.
<p>(7) i do not follow for follow. if we write together continuously, or we have plotted something out long term I have no problem hitting the follow button. otherwise i prefer to keep a relatively clean dash. this is nothing against you. this is for myself and my dash.
<p>(8) when it comes to unfollowing it is usually done for the following reasons: inactive for thirty (30) days or more, too much ooc content, posting of drama, or too much negativity. i’m here to write, have fun, and forget about the real world for just a little bit. if you decide to return to your inactive blog and we were mutuals feel free to hit me up and i’ll refollow. otherwise i figure you have decided to move on from that blog and see no point in following an inactive one.
<p>(9) i will also unfollow anyone who decides to attack, harass, or do anything similar to those i consider my friends. in my opinion if you go after someone i call friend you are going after me and i will not tolerate that no matter what.
<p>(10) please do not contact me and ask why i unfollowed you. any and all such asks will be deleted as they are covered in the rules. harassing me in such a matter will only lead me to block you instead of just unfollowing you.
<p>(11) do not god-mod my character. if i catch you doing so without my permission consider the thread dropped.
<p>(12) this is a hate free blog. any hate received will be deleted on sight. if i find those i follow sending hate i will unfollow you in a heartbeat. remember to treat others as you would like to be treated in return.
<p>(13) with this blog i prefer to roleplay multi-para to novella. while i can write one liners i feel like there is no character development to those threads and can be easily dropped. multi-para to me is a minimum of three paragraphs, while novella is anywhere over 1k words.
<p>(14) please <b>do not reblog</b> threads unless you are a participant in them. feel free to like them all you want but unless you and i are writing together i ask that you don’t reblog them as it makes it difficult to keep up with whose turn it is in the thread.
<p>(15) please <b>make a new post</b> if you want to continue asks. i am all for continuing asks but i will not respond to any that have not been moved into a new post.
<p>(16) interactions with muns 21+ is preferred. muns 18-21 will be considered & there will be no interactions with muns under 18. if you have no age listed on your blog i won’t interact nor follow.
<br /><br />

<p><center><h3>the mun&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>
<p>(1) the mun has a life outside of tumblr and asks that everyone please be patient. any and all replies that are seen will be replied to. if for some reason a reply has been missed a gentle reminder in the ask box is appreciated. but please do not constantly harass the mun for a reply.
<p>(2) the mun is of age (21+) which means there will be nsfw elements on this blog. that could mean violence, torture, gore, and scenes of a sexual nature. we will not write sexual scenes with those who are under 18. there is the option of fade to black or the morning after for those who are not of age
<p>(3) all nsfw posts will be tagged for your blacklisting purposes.
<br /><br />

<p><center><h3>relationships&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>
<p>(1) this is a multi-ship, multi-verse blog. i ship chemistry first and foremost. if there is chemistry a relationship is possible. this applies to all verses. 
<p>(2) when it comes to relationships, jace considers himself bisexual with a preference for women. he’s not one to be tied down to a relationship and with his life being what it is sex is something he uses as an outlet. jace will also consider platonic or even hate relationships.
<p>(3) <b>if you write clary</b>: while i do acknowledge this relationship is canon i will not roleplay it instantly. first, we need to have written together to make certain that our writing styles are compatible. after that i ask that we have at least spoken out of character first and then i would like something plotted out long term. all the plotting in the world won’t mean a damn if there is no chemistry and the writing styles aren’t compatible.
<p>(4) please do not force a ship on me. nor try to engage us in instant ships. i prefer all ships to be written out and developed over time. forced shipping, instant ships, etc. are the fastest way to send us both running in the opposite direction.
<p>(5) there is more to jace than just his fc. if you are here to do nothing more than to get into bed with him i ask that you do not follow. i am not here to write purely smut. I prefer to write threads with plots and if smut happens, it happens as part of the thread.
<br /><br />


<p><center><h3>exclusivity&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>
<p>(1) this blog most likely won’t practise exclusivity. at least not within the shadowhunter fandom. we will have mains and those will be limited to no more than <b>three</b> (3) of each muse.
<p>(2) when it comes to relationships, this blog <b>does</b> practise exclusivity. at this time this blog is ship exclusive with:<br /><br />

<p>what this means is that we will not ship with any other alec lightwood besides those two. please do not approach me for a jalec ship as you will be turned down. 
<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9642;&nbsp;<b>ash morgenstern:</b>&nbsp;<a href="https://affcgato.tumblr.com">affcgato</a>
<p>this is a father/son relationship. what this means is jace will not consider any other ash morgensterns as his "son". the mun and i have worked at establishing this relationship and i will not be exploring it with any others. i will write with other ash morgensterns but this will be the only father/son relationship.
<br /><br />

<p><center><h3>original characters &amp; children&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>
<p>(1) this blog is oc friendly but selective due to past problems. i will give your muse a chance but if i feel like our writing styles are incompatible i will drop the thread.
<p>(2) in regards to children, jace will not acknowledge any original characters that claim him as the father. please don’t take this personally as this is nothing against you, the mun, but a personal preference of mine. 
<p>(3) at this time the only character jace will acknowledge as his is <b><a href="https://affcgato.tumblr.com">ash morgenstern</a></b>

<h4>overview</h4>
<br />
Jonathan Christopher "Jace" Herondale is considered the best Shadowhunter of his generation and a hero of the Mortal and Dark wars. He is currently the co-head of the New York Institute, alongside his fiancée, Clary Fairchild.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>early life</h3></center>
<p>Jace was born to Stephen and Céline Herondale. While he was still in Céline's womb, Valentine Morgenstern constantly gave Céline doses of Ithuriel's blood to mix with her food, and she took it, not knowing what it really was. Ithuriel's blood made its way into unborn baby Jace's system, thus he was born differently from other Shadowhunters.
<p>Eventually, Valentine had his parents killed. Desperate for the baby he had been giving angel blood to, Valentine had Hodge Starkweather help him take the child from Céline's dead body shortly after—it is said that the only reason that Jace survived was because of the increased amount of angel blood in his body. After faking his and his real son's death, Valentine took off with both Jonathan and Jace and raised them separately, hoping that one or both of them would grow to become very powerful warriors—one with angel blood and the other with demon. While Valentine took the identity of Michael Wayland, Jace was raised as Jonathan Wayland, both of whom were, in fact, the father-and-son Valentine killed to fake their deaths.
<p>Jace was raised by Valentine believing that they were the Waylands, and they lived in the Waylands' estate. Jace's upbringing was both loving and harsh; Valentine trained him as a warrior, strictly and with the occasional beating, but also treated him with some level of kindness. Valentine also insisted that Jace learn to play an instrument, and he taught him the piano. Jace was also taught other languages by Valentine. Despite the extremely disciplined upbringing, they shared some father-son moments and lessons that Jace cherished. Growing up, Jace always looked forward to his birthday because it was when Valentine always let Jace do or have what he wanted: horses, weapons, books, and even a bath in spaghetti on his fifth birthday.
<p>Valentine instilled thoughts such as "to love is to destroy and that to be loved is to be the one destroyed" into his mind. In an attempt to teach him this, Valentine gave him a wild falcon to train when he was six, intending it to be a killing companion. After some struggle and a long time, Jace tamed the bird that had initially seemed impossible to train and loved it. Jace excitedly showed it to his father, but Valentine broke its neck, saying that he was supposed to train it to become obedient, not to love him.
<p>When he was ten, Valentine realized that Jace was too soft for his plans but needed to move forward with his plans. For this, Valentine yet again staged his death as Michael Wayland, with a hiding Jace there to witness his father "killed" right in front of him, convincing Jace and everyone else of "Michael's" death. As he had anticipated when he took Michael's identity, Jace was adopted by the Lightwoods, where Valentine knew Jace would be well cared for, as well as in a good position for possible reconnaissance at a later time.
<p>Jace was brought to New York City on a passenger ship full of werewolves smuggling Yin fen into the city. Robert Lightwood had snuck aboard a long with Brother Zachariah and a couple vampires to stop them. When battle broke out, Jace came out and joined in the fight, using the Silent Brother's staff. Afterwards, Jace and Brother Zachariah discussed parabatai and how they make you better. Jace had initially thought they were a weakness because of his father, but having heard they could make you a better warrior, Jace began to hope he would find one in New York.
<p>Jace became good friends with the Lightwood children, Alec and Isabelle Lightwood. The eldest, Alec, eventually became his parabatai. The youngest, Max, grew to look up to Jace. The family matriarch Maryse also gave him his nickname Jace, after he told them that his full name was Jonathan Christopher, which he had seen in Valentine's journal, not knowing that it wasn't referring to him.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>valentine's return</h3></center>
<p>Jace would spend the next seven years forming a solid bond with the Lightwoods and was treated much like a true son by Maryse and Robert. In particular, he, Alec, and Isabelle made a formidable Shadowhunting team. One fateful night in August 2007, the trio went scouting at the Pandemonium Club. They had lured a demon into a closet and were about to kill it when they were interrupted by a girl, Clary Fray, that Alec had assumed was a mundane girl. They slipped away shortly after, but Jace remained intrigued and told Hodge about her. When Hodge asked to see the girl, Jace volunteered to go.
<p>Jace followed her to Java Jones the next evening, and when she confronted him, he told her about Shadowhunters and told her that he doubted that she was ordinary. Clary then received a call from her mother, and when Clary returned home that night, her mother had already been taken. Clary was then poisoned by a Ravener demon, forcing Jace to test his theory by giving her a rune—an iratze.
<p>Coinciding with the disappearance of Clary's mother, Jocelyn, were the rumors that Valentine Morgenstern, whom Jace was unaware was also Clary's father, had returned from the dead. The Conclave then decided to take Clary in and help her look for her mother, hoping it would lead them to the truth about Valentine. While Izzy and Alec were both skeptical about helping the stranger, Hodge was insistent about helping an old friend, and Jace found himself strangely compelled to help their guest, though he denied this.
<p>During their adventures, Jace met Madame Dorothea, who they later killed while possessed by the Greater Demon Abbadon, werewolf and former Shadowhunter Luke Garroway, High Warlock of Brooklyn, Magnus Bane, the New York vampire clan and its acting head Raphael Santiago, and, to Jace's dismay, Clary's mundane best friend Simon Lewis.
<p>Jace had been interested in Clary since the moment they met, though he acted as though he was annoyed by her thus causing her to find him arrogant. However, one evening, when he found out that Clary's birthday was upon them, Jace invited Clary to join him in the Institute's greenhouse. They bonded over stories that Jace told about his childhood and soon shared a passionate kiss. They left and Jace walked Clary to her room, only to find Simon waiting inside. When Simon assumed that they were there for another reason, Clary tried to explain herself. Jace was offended, as he saw it as Clary dismissing their feelings and shrugged her off when she tried to apologize.
<p>Despite this, Jace still continued to help Clary. At one point, when Alec was gravely injured during their encounter with the demon Abbadon, Jace went to a dark place and began to blame himself.
<p>Eventually, when Clary was finally able to retrieve the Mortal Cup, Hodge's betrayed them. Knocking Jace out and leaving a helpless Clary to watch, trapped in an invisible casing, Hodge contacted Valentine Morgenstern with Jace's ring. In exchange for his release from his curse, Hodge gave Valentine the Cup and Jace.
<p>During their time together at Renwick's, Jace realized that Valentine was the man who had raised him, pretending to be Michael Wayland. Suddenly keen on reuniting with his father, Jace momentarily decided to side with Valentine. Upon Clary's arrival, Valentine revealed to Jace that they were siblings, which he refused to believe. Luke soon followed after Clary and began to tell Jace about Valentine and Jocelyn's past, facts which Clary later reinforced. During the confrontation, Jace began to doubt his decision as he learned more about his "father". While Valentine fought Luke, he saw the kind of man he was. With Clary's urging, Jace finally turned against him.
<p>Truly believing Valentine's lies, Jace was lead to believe that he was the brother of the girl he had fallen in love with. Heartbroken, Jace reverted to his old ways of keeping his distance from those he cared about.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>wandering jace</h3></center>
<p>Jace was thrown out from the Institute after Maryse found out the truth about Valentine being his father. Jace then went to the Hunter's Moon bar where Luke's werewolf pack were and started a fight with them by intentionally aggravating them with his indifference to the curious death of one the pack's younger members. Luke managed to stop the fight and called Clary to come help calm him down. Jace told them that he had been thrown out of the Institute and didn't know why.
<p>Luke, Clary, and Jace decided to go to the Institute to question Maryse Lightwood. She told them that the Inquisitor was coming to talk to him about him being Valentine's son and that she was trying to protect Jace. Nonetheless, Jace decided to stay and face the Inquisitor, believing that by avoiding her things would become worse.
<p>Later on, due to his disrespectful behavior towards the Inquisitor, Imogen Herondale, he was forced to spend a night in jail in the Silent City. While in the cell, Jace suddenly heard the screams of the Silent Brothers which were caused by Agramon—the Greater Demon of Fear who was now under Valentine's command. After the slaughter of the Silent Brothers, Valentine visited Jace and told him that he had killed them to get the Mortal Sword.
<p>Meanwhile, Clary, Isabelle, and Alec decided to go and rescue Jace after receiving a distress call from the Silent City. The Inquisitor believed that Jace helped Valentine kill the Silent Brothers in order to get the Mortal Sword and that it was only taken to prevent his testimony. After a lot of debate, they finally agreed to let Jace stay in Magnus Bane's apartment, under the condition that a magical restraint was placed on him.
<p>Later on, due to the unexplained and mysterious deaths of different Downworlders, Jace and the others visited the Faerie Realm. While there, Clary was tricked into eating faerie food, meaning that she wouldn't be able to leave along with the others. However, the Seelie Queen told her that if she got the kiss that she most desired, she would be able to leave. When Simon's kiss failed to free Clary, Jace kissed her and successfully broke the spell, which angered Simon, thus making him leave the group at Central Park.
<p>After their return to the Institute, Clary and Jace fought about their feelings for each other. Jace said he didn't see why they couldn't still be together and wanted to keep the relationship a secret, while Clary said that the idea repulsed her and that their feelings for each other were wrong.
<p>They were soon interrupted by Raphael Santiago's appearance at the Institute with Simon's corpse in his hands. He informed them about Simon having shown up at the Hotel Dumort and being subsequently drained of blood, and that he would either be Turned into a vampire or have to be fully killed. Clary decided to bury Simon in a Jewish cemetery for his resurrection as a vampire.
<p>Upon learning about Valentine's plan to turn the Mortal Sword into a demon instrument, Jace visited his father, who was currently hiding on a boat. When he returned from his visit, the Inquisitor, having used a tracker on him, kept him prisoner in a Malachi Configuration. She then proceeded to tell him about her plan to threaten Valentine in order to get the Mortal Instruments by using Jace's life. Jace tried to tell her that it would not work but she didn't believe him. Later with some help from Alec, he managed to escape.
<p>Before facing off Valentine and trying to save both Maia Roberts and Simon, who were both captured for the ritual on his boat, Jace asked Clary to draw the Fearless rune on him. While on-board the ship, Jace found Simon dead and fed him his blood in order to save him. The rest of the Shadowhunters soon arrived and a chaotic battle began on the boat. During the battle, Jace was confronted by Imogen, who apologized and looked really astonished when Jace told her once more that he did not know Valentine was his father. Imogen then noticed his star-shaped scar and tried to tell him something but Jace, angered by the Inquisitor's behavior, left to join the battle. He was then attacked by a demon that could have killed him had the Inquisitor not interfered, saving him. Having realized that he was her grandson, Imogen told Jace his father would be proud, leaving Jace more confused than before—thinking that Imogen was insulting him and referring to Valentine—before dying in his arms.
<p>Soon afterward the battle ended with the ship being completely destroyed by Clary's Opening rune. Later, Jace told Clary that he would, from now on, act like her brother and nothing more.
<br />

<center><h3>the mortal war</h3></center>
<p>After being called to Alicante, Jace was making preparations in order to leave with the rest of his family to Idris, alongside Clary. However, Jace, believing that Idris was too dangerous for Clary and at the same time wanting to stop thinking about her, decided to trick Clary with the help of Simon. Simon reluctantly agreed but when the Lightwoods were ready to leave through a Portal, they were attacked by a group of Forsaken. And amidst the chaos created, Jace was forced to take Simon with him, something which was illegal since permission was required for Downworlders to enter Idris.
<p>While in Idris, Jace spent a lot of time with Aline Penhallow and her cousin Sebastian Verlac. But his peace was soon interrupted when Clary appeared. Jace, afraid of his feelings for her, distanced himself and even yelled at her. Thus, allowing Sebastian to come closer to Clary. Nevertheless, upon the discovery of the fact that the Book of the White was hidden inside the library in the Wayland manor, Clary asked Jace to help her. Jace agreed and they went together.
<p>There they discovered the Angel Ithuriel trapped in the basement. Clary having the ability to create runes, freed the Angel, but not before she and Jace were shown some memories of Valentine's experimentation on both of his children. Jace, believing that he had demon blood in his veins, was inconsolable.
<p>Meanwhile, in Idris, Sebastian had broken the wards thus allowing Valentine's army of demons to enter and destroy everything. A great battle began, and after breaking Simon out of Clave prison, Jace was informed about Sebastian's betrayal and murder of his little brother, Max. Burning with anger and self-hatred because of all the events, Jace decided to track down both Sebastian and Valentine but not before deciding to spend his possible last night with Clary, finally declaring his love for her and sleeping beside her.
<p>After following the tracking spell Jace found a cave outside Idris where Valentine and Sebastian discussed their plan to summon Raziel and destroy all Downworlders and the Shadowhunters who would not bend their knee. Valentine then left for Lake Lyn, and Sebastian, having already sensed Jace's presence, started to tease him. After a while they both fought each other, ending with Sebastian on top of him revealing his true identity as Jonathan Christopher Morgenstern and informing Jace that he was the son of Stephen Herondale. Just as he was about to deliver the death blow, Isabelle found them and saved Jace by cutting off Jonathan's hand. With Jonathan distracted by beating up Izzy, Jace pushed himself up and found an opening to kill him.
<p>Later on, he found Valentine, who was ready to summon the Raziel and had silenced Clary with a rune. Valentine looked shocked when Jace told him that he killed Jonathan but, other than that, he didn't show any other emotion and before Jace could finish him off, Valentine stabbed him. Clary, upon witnessing all this, changed the ritual runes causing to her being the master of the summoning of Raziel, not Valentine. Raziel, knowing Valentine's motives and what he had done to Ithuriel, killed him. When asked for her wish, Clary requested that he resurrect Jace, which he did.
<p>Despite everything, Jace still mourned Valentine's death. A few days after the battle, there was a big celebration in the city over their victory against Valentine's forces in what eventually became known as the Mortal War. Jace and Clary reformed their relationship, free to be together after all.
<br />

<center><h3>haunted by lilith</h3></center>
<p>Six weeks after the events of the Mortal War, Jace was now training Clary and the two enjoyed their relationship. However, he began to have some nightmares which always ended with him murdering Clary. Jace, fearing that he was losing control, decided to distance himself from Clary.
<p>To avoid Clary, but still do right by her, he spent most of his time protecting Simon—who had become a bit of a target. After a while, and after Clary had taken the risk of going after a cult alone, Jace could no longer bury his emotions and told Clary about his nightmares.
<p>Hoping to find a way to stop these nightmares, they visited the Silent Brothers, who informed them that with Jace's death and resurrection, the magic from the protection ritual placed on all newborn Shadowhunters had faded; leaving him extremely vulnerable to demon possession and influence. They kept Jace in the Silent City in order to perform it again.
<p>However, during the night, Jace dreamed of his lost brother, Max. Max gave him a knife, telling him to cut himself in order to be released from the demon's possession, then used the blood to mark him with Lilith's mark. Jace woke up under completely under her influence, with the rune still on his chest. He left the Silent City and went to Jocelyn's engagement party. There he kidnapped Clary: knocking her out with a rune and carrying her to the top of an unfinished building where Lilith was preparing a resurrection ritual for Jonathan.
<p>Eventually, Clary, Simon, and Jace—having Lilith's influence disrupted by Clary cutting the rune—defeated Lilith. Standing alone on the roof guarding Jonathan's body, Jace noticed, to his surprise, the rune over his chest had healed. Jonathan, through Lilith's rune, had now gained power over Jace and compelled him to complete the ritual. Though Jace was screaming internally to stop, he could not gain control of his body. Sebastian—as he would choose to be known—awakened and he and Jace disappeared before the others returned.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>bound to sebastian</h3></center>
<p>Jace's state and whereabouts were unknown for weeks after he disappeared with Sebastian, worrying his family and friends. Moreover, the Clave's priorities shifted from locating Sebastian and Jace to repairing the wards on Wrangel Island (as they had recently been smashed through) and updating the Law and Council to now that Downworlders were getting representatives, as well as electing a new Consul and Inquisitor.
<p>Meanwhile, Jace and Sebastian were traveling all over the world preparing for Sebastian's plan. Jace, unable to stay away from Clary, visited her and asked her to follow them. Clary was considering the offer but their meeting was cut short when Jocelyn saw Sebastian in her kitchen and screamed. Their little adventure ended with Sebastian throwing a silver dagger to Luke and leaving with Jace. Jace's allegiance to Sebastian was confirmed.
<p>Jace came back for Clary early that morning and found her on the front porch of Luke's house waiting for him. Clary joined them and Sebastian and Jace kept working on their plans without explaining them to her. Clary tried to understand the connection between her brother and boyfriend but she couldn't find a way to help Jace, not without raising suspicions.
<p>Jace, still under Lilith's spell, participated in all of Sebastian's plans and at the same time dated Clary. He was the happiest Clary had ever seen him. However, after an unfortunate turn of events, his bond with Sebastian was temporarily severed and he was able to say the truth to Clary about the Infernal Cup and Sebastian's real intentions, after which he unsuccessfully tried to flee to the Clave in order to turn in the Cup and himself. After his attempted escape, his Twinning rune that bound him to Sebastian healed and he was back under his control.
<p>Once at the Seventh Sacred Site, Sebastian, with Jace and Clary by his side, was preparing to create his own army of Endarkened, when Jace's family and the New York werewolf pack came in, along with Simon holding the Glorious. Simon passed this to Clary explaining that the blade would burn out all the evil in whoever it struck, and thus should destroy the bond. Unable to reach Sebastian, Clary used the Glorious and stabbed Jace, believing that it wouldn't kill him as his heart was more good than evil. Jace was set alight, severing the connection between the two and leading the others to believe that he was dead. Sebastian enraged fled with his army.
<p>However, after a few moments, Clary noticed his heart was still beating and he was taken to the Institute to be cured by Brother Zachariah. When Clary was finally allowed to visit Jace, he told her that stabbing him with Glorious had filled him with Heavenly fire, which could burn anything he touched. Jordan Kyle soon started teaching Jace to meditate in hopes that it would help him be able to control the heavenly fire.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>the dark war</h3></center>
<p>Concerned about Alec and Magnus's break up, and asked by Izzy, Jace visited Magnus and talk to him. Jace bluntly pointed out that he was obviously unhappy since his apartment was a mess and he had take-out containers everywhere, clearly gorging himself on take-out food. However, that did not help.
<p>Due to the several attacks on different Institutes by the Sebastian's Endarkened army, they were all ordered to pack up and gather in Idris for an emergency meeting of the Clave. At that meeting, Jace first met the Blackthorn children and Emma Carstairs. By the end of the meeting, the Clave decided to use the heavenly fire within Jace to defeat Sebastian, although they did not know how to get the fire out of him.
<p>Jace and Clary took a nighttime walk around the city. The two ultimately ended up in an alley, where, despite Jace's hesitation, Clary succeeded in kissing him. Their kissing escalated so quickly that Jace lost control over the heavenly fire, which caused him to burn handprints into the brick wall he was leaning against. He felt so panicked and fearful that he would hurt Clary that he quickly pulled away.
<p>The next day, Jace took Clary to buy her a new sword. Diana Wrayburn, the owner of the shop, then gave Clary a Morgenstern family shortsword called Heosphoros, for free. While Clary blessed her sword in Accords Hall fountain, they saw the demon towers light up in the color of battle. Despite not being allowed, the two went through a Portal and joined the battle at Adamant Citadel. Jace fought Sebastian, who then stabbed Jace. Surprised and hurt by the heavenly fire that leaked out of the wound, Sebastian and his army fled the battle. Brother Zachariah attempted to heal Jace but was engulfed in flames. Clary marked Jace with an Agony healing rune powerful enough to heal him.
<p>Sebastian soon kidnapped the Downworld representatives, along with Jocelyn, and held them hostage, demanding the Clave hand over Jace and Clary for their return. While waiting for the Clave's decision, Emma told Jace and the others that Sebastian and his army had hinted at staying in another dimension called Edom when they had attacked her Institute. After Alec did some research, Jace, Clary, Simon, Alec, and Isabelle escaped to rescue them by going through faerie tunnels to get there. Once in the other dimension, Clary was able to use a rune she imagined to transfer the heavenly fire from Jace into Heosphoros. He and Clary came up with a plan that they kept from the others which worked out well and allowed Clary to get close enough to stab Sebastian with it, killing him and his army along with him.
<p>To get home they had to make a deal with Magnus's father, the Prince of Hell Asmodeus. This resulted in a sacrifice from Simon, giving up his immortality and being a vampire along with his memories of the Shadow World and the others, including Clary. Clary and Izzy were visibly upset for a long time after, and though Jace tried not to show it, he also greatly missed Simon.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3>finding himself</h3></center>
<p>After the war, Jace decided to take the name of Herondale; deciding that just because he had complicated feelings for his father, didn't mean the legendary line should end with him. At Jocelyn and Luke's wedding in May 2008, he was given a Herondale family ring from Tessa Gray, which helped him feel more complete.
<p>During the reception, Simon appeared, having been able to retrieve some of his memories from Magnus. Though Jace was happy for a chance to have Simon back, he continued to mess with him by telling him fake stories of his life.
<p>Later that year, Jace was invited to the Shadowhunter Academy—where they had sent Simon in hopes of helping him regain all his memories through Ascension—to teach a lesson as a guest tutor. There, he confessed to Simon he had been doing research into his family history to try to understand what it meant to be a Herondale. He struggled to piece together his identity and felt like he was expected to be a hero; the burden of the past—both the negative and the positive—became a lot for him to bear. Simon pointed him in the direction of their guest lecturer, Tessa, who revealed herself to be his ancestor. They met and conversed about the Herondales and Jace felt better knowing there was someone who shared his blood and understood it all. She even took him and Clary on a tour of the Herondale manor.
<p>Jace had since become more serious about his passion for music. He'd begun to play more challenging pieces and composing, even collaborating once with fellow musician, Simon, on "Come Back, Meow", a song dedicated to Chairman Meow.

<h4>statistics</h4>
<br />
<center><h3>runes & other identifying marks</h3></center>
<p>Jace’s runes are built to strengthen and reinforce his abilities. He carries many generic battle runes used to amplify his natural strength, speed and grounding, but he also possesses a Gift/Talent rune, which suggests a superior skill beneath the surface. He also has the Calm Anger and Promise runes, which could allude to the vengeance of his father’s death.

<center><h3>personality traits</h3></center>
<p>Seen as narcissistic, gorgeous, determined and an expert Shadowhunter, Jace is a natural-born leader and is Alec’s second-in-command whenever on assignments with him and Isabelle. Jace is headstrong and often prefers to act first and ask permission later. Tough, resourceful, and confident, Jace takes slaying demons in his stride, often admiring himself while he does so.
<p>He is incredibly loyal to his allies and will stop at nothing to help and save them when necessary. Jace is prepared to risk his life and standing with the Clave to protect others, easily doing so to prevent harm to others. As the adoptive son of Maryse and Robert, he has a fierce love for his adoptive family, especially his adoptive siblings Alec and Isabelle, whom he can be quite protective of.
<p>Like most of his kind, Jace was raised to view love and feelings as a distraction from their sacred mission, though he was not completely averse to it either, specifically after Clary’s presence and influence.
<p>Jace is usually sarcastic and humorous. He is also incredibly stubborn, as seen with his recurring arguments with Alec. He can be impatient and easily annoyed when things are not moving forward, or when his skill is called into question. Beneath the humor lies a darker side, one where Jace has always felt like an outsider and was further driven to believe he was tainted after Valentine’s lie. He is prone to excessive drinking and indulging in sex to distract himself from more negative emotions, preferring those outlets to talking about his feelings with someone.

<br />

<center><h3>skills &amp; abilities</h3></center>
<p><b>Nephilim physiology:</b> Being Nephilim, Jace possesses a variety of enhanced physical and mental abilities granted to him by the angel blood of Raziel in his veins and also by the angelic Marks of the Gray Book. This includes enhanced strength, speed, agility, stamina, and coordination, which continue to improve over time and practice.
<p><b>The Sight:</b> As a Shadowhunter, Jace is naturally and easily able to see through most magical illusions and layers of glamour over reality.
<p><b>Runic magic:</b> Due to the angel blood in their veins, all Shadowhunters are able to apply runes on their skin without any real danger. These Marks, in turn, give varied effects that serve to benefit the wearer.
<p><b>Use of heavenly weapons:</b> As a Shadowhunter, Jace is also able to perform tasks unique to their species, such as the ability to use and call on the power of angels for their seraph blades, as well as to handle any heavenly weapons or objects with effect, which would normally not work for other species. In particular, these are tools made of adamas and forged by Iron Sisters. 
<p><b>Parabatai bond:</b> Due to his parabatai bond with Alec Lightwood, Jace is able to call on more strength in battle and is able to use certain runes or magic exclusive to parabatai. The runes drawn on him by, or shared with, Alec also give a considerably stronger effect. This also allows them to parabatai track. 
<p><b>Angelic blood empowerment:</b> Like Clary, Jace has pure angel blood, due to an experiment performed on him as an unborn child, and this apparently gave him enhanced strength, speed, and others superior to those of normal Shadowhunters’. 
<p><b>Rune activation:</b> Jace is able to activate runes on his and others’ bodies without having to use his stele. When he does this, his eyes turn gold.
<p><b>Blood connection:</b> Because of their angel blood, Jace and Clary share a connection, both with each other and with the source of their blood, Ithuriel. In addition, Clary’s blood relation to Jonathan Morgenstern gives Jace an indirect connection to him as well.
<p><b>Expert hand-to-hand combatant:</b> Jace is highly skilled in armed and unarmed combat.
<p><b>Expert swordsman:</b> Jace is highly skilled and proficient in swordsmanship.
<p><b>Skilled pianist:</b> Jace is highly proficient in playing the piano, from being under the tutelage of Valentine Morgenstern during his childhood. 

<br />

<center><h3>possessions</h3></center>
<p><b>Basic Shadowhunter gear, including:</b> a steles, seraph blades, and witchlight.
<p><b>Daggers and swords:</b> Aside from seraph blades, Jace has also used daggers and swords in battle.
<p><b>Herondale family ring:</b> When Imogen Herondale learned that Jace was a Herondale, she gave him the family ring, which previously belonged to his mother, Céline. He now wears the ring on a chain as a necklace.

<p>jace is the son of celine (an atlantean princess) and stephen (a human lighthouse keeper). When the throne was overthrown by valentine celine fled to the surface and was found by stephen. They ended up falling in love and their son jace was born. Not long after he was born valentine sent forces to retrieve celine to punish her for treason. Instead of allowing herself to be taken alive she begged stephen to keep their son safe and took her own life. Jace was raised to think he was as human as everyone else around him although he tends to be drawn to the ocean and has a strange connection to the animals under the sea. 
<p>In this verse jace will always have legs no matter what unlike his little mermaid based verse where he will have to choose between human legs and mermaid tails.

<p>The first Immortal. Not something Jonathan had ever thought would happen to him. Demons had been rampaging the earth and it had been up to him and a few others to put a stop to it. His death hadn’t been quick but it had been painful, something he would never forget. Once the battle was done he was the only one to survive and with it came the realisation that he would live forever. Not something Jonathan had wanted. He wandered the earth alone, wondering if he would always be alone or if someone would finally join him. The dream hit him and seeing the girl he happened to get to Andromache’s side as she came to. Unfortunately, he couldn’t stay with her. He knew that it would be dangerous and telling her that all would be okay. And it would. The dreams were ones he learned to ignore and in time he’d preferred being a hermit. Until he had no other choice. Andromache would always know where to find him and while he had spent his time wandering the world, should she need him he would be there.

<p>ever since the incursion, humanity has sought a way to fight back against the demonic hoards threatening to drown the world in their darkness. after a millennia of struggle, hope emerged in the form of bond between those with magical blood & a strange bloodline - the daemon. magic had long been used to combate the growing threat of darkness, but had unpredictable rates of success due to its unstable nature. a bond with a daemon was found to stabilize that force, allowing for more powerful, predictable results.
<p>there is only one problem; the number of daemon has always been far, far eclipsed by the number of witches & warlocks seeking to partner with them. add to this the caveat that while a witch or warlock might court a familiar, in the end it's solely the <b>DAEMON'S CHOICE</b> to consent to a bond. because of this, powerful witches & warlocks have tortured them, forcing them to consent so they can bolster their power.
<p>after being experimented on before his birth jace was born a powerful warlock to stephen & celine. intially wanting to stick by valentine’s side to help him achieve his  goals they found that their son needed a familiar to keep himself from doing more harm. not long after jace was born they ran from idris and went into hiding in new york, raising their son in as normal a life as possible. once he reached a certain age he was brought to the new york institute of sorcery to be matched with a potential familiar
