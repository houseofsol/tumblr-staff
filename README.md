these are the codes currently in use across my blogs and the ones i'd like the javascript exceptions for.

I was trying to add a live preview page to houseofsol using the cxpt-themetesting code. 

A live preview page is where you copy the source code from the blog into a new page so that someone can see how a theme works without having to copy the code and install it themselves. 

When I tried to add the code to a page, I got the javascript error code that I contacted you about.
